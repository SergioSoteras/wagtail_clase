      "reviewBody": "Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption. \n\nThe only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.\n\nI didn&apos;t intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don&apos;t normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, &quot;Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better.&quot; At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.\n\nNo action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.\n\nThe Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it&apos;s technical merits - I don&apos;t really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.",

      "reviewBody": "There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I&apos;ve seen, so much so I couldn&apos;t think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn&apos;t see this film before now.\n\nTrue, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.\n\nThe Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.\n\nThen there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse&apos;s head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.\n\nThe acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino&apos;s casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.\n\nIn conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox",

      "reviewBody": "This is one of those movies where everything could go wrong. The story is as simple as it can be: 12 men are jurors on a open and shut murder trial, but one man thinks that another persons life deserves at least some thought on the matter and votes not guilty. From this point on we have 12 actors and a closed room. This could be the most boring film ever made. Lumet however is a master of mise-en-scene and provides a tense movie that keeps you locked on from the word &quot;go&quot;. The dialogs are great and supported by incredibly talented actors. Joel Schumacher in Phone Booth needed to see this movie and draw a few ideas on how to make a character built, dialog driven movie. A must see for everyone.",

At first I thought, well, maybe I&apos;ll watch a few minutes of it- it&apos;s so depressing but I feel like watching a good movie for a change.  I hadn&apos;t seen this picture in several years since it was released. The first time I saw the film, in the theater, I went with my parents and was somewhat in denial.  I tried to block out the pain that was before me and retain my composure.  After realizing its brilliance, I tried to forget the film.  It certainly wasn&apos;t something to dwell on.\n\nThis time when I watched the film I really surprised myself.  I sat and cried like I haven&apos;t in years- but that&apos;s a good thing.  I&apos;ve been so divorced from my feelings and so wrapped up in my own selfish hell that I forgot what life is capable of becoming.\n\nNow, Spielberg himself has admitted that he tends to over-sentimentalize things.  Take the scene when Stern has just been rescued from the train by Schindler and as the two men walk away the camera pans to a large room where the suitcases of  countless other souls less fortunate are being trifled through; a  pile of personal photographs of  family lay strewn amidst wasted boots and eye glasses.  That scene destroyed me with emotion yet it was something that actually happened.\n\nI will admit that towards the end, when Schindler was going on about how he could have sold his car to save more lives or sold his pin- even on second inspection, that scene seems rather forced- even enough for Jerry Seinfeld to mock.  I was kind of mad at Spielberg.  I mean, doesn&apos;t he know when to back off.  It seems with an absolute masterpiece like this film, he would have been more careful and edited out this truly &quot;sentimental&quot; passage with violins going haywire.\n\nRegardless, I&apos;m in awe of this picture and with his latest- Saving Private Ryan, I do think that Spielberg is truly one of, if not, the greatest directors of film ever."

      "reviewBody": "Feeling weary and battle-worn, I have just staggered out of the cinema after three and a half hours of special effects creatures fighting other special effects creatures. I had taken refreshments but barely touched them - probably because the film I had watched is one of the most mesmerising, evocative, inspiring, and awesome I have witnessed of any big adventure epic. Not to mention superb ensemble acting, moods that shift effortlessly between mediaeval battles of colossal proportions and convincing bloodshed, beauty and wonderment, fantastic natural and artificial landscapes and cityscapes, touches of humour, well-paced dramatic tension, and human bonding that is moving enough to just let you dry your eyes as the unassuming credits flash by.\n\nReturn of the King is the greatest of the Tolkien trilogy by New Zealand director Peter Jackson. Although I&apos;ve seen the other two and read the book, I felt it would also stand alone well enough for people who hadn&apos;t done either.\n\nThe storytelling is much more professional that the first one - which maybe laboured to introduce so much information - or the second one - which has little let up from the tension of long battle scenes. In Return of the King, there is an emotional sting at the start, as we watch the transformation of Gollum from warm, fun-loving guy to murderous, mutated wretch. The movie then moves deftly between different segments of the story - the sadness of the lovely soft-focus Liv Tyler as fated Arwen whose travails and woman&apos;s love succeeds in having the Sword that was Broken mended, the comradeship of Sam and Frodo (Sean Astin &amp; Elijah Wood) that is tested to the limits, the strong commanding presence of Gandalf (Ian McKellen) who keeps an eye on things whilst turning in an Oscar-worthy performance, the ingenious and very varied battle scenes, and the mythical cities of that rise out of the screen and provide key plot elements.\n\nThis is a fairy story of human endeavour, the defeating of power cliques and the triumph of the human spirit that could almost be compared to Wagner&apos;s Gotterdammerung. It is a fairy story without any sugary sweetness, a fairy story the likes of which hasn&apos;t been told so well before, and is even unlikely to be done so well in the future. The haunting scream of the Nasgul stays with you, the physical attractions are not airbrushed, and the battles are about as far from pantomime characters waving wooden swords as you can get. The ingenious monsters keep you on the edge of your seat. The whole narrative maintains the spirit (if not archival, detailed accuracy) of the original and makes you want to read the book (or read the book again!)\n\nThe worst I can say about it is that it is maybe a tad long - but not that you&apos;d notice . . .",

      "reviewBody": "I can only speak for myself, but I had never seen anything as stylish, cleverly constructed, well written and electrifying as this milestone when I first saw it in 1994. What really pulled me in right from the start is what we&apos;ve now come to know as a Tarantino trademark: the dialogue. When gangsters Jules and Vincent talk to each other (or all the other characters, for that matter) there is a natural flow, a sense of realism and yet something slightly over the top and very theatrical about their lines \u2013 it&apos;s a mixture that immediately grabs your attention (even if it&apos;s just two dudes talking about what kind of hamburger they prefer, or contemplating the value of a foot-massage). Then there&apos;s the music: the songs Tarantino chose for his masterpiece fit their respective scenes so perfectly that most of those pieces of music are now immediately associated with &apos;Pulp Fiction&apos;. And the narrative: the different story lines that come together, the elegantly used flashbacks, the use of &quot;chapters&quot; \u2013 there is so much playful creativity at play here, it&apos;s just a pure joy to watch.\n\nIf you&apos;re a bit of a film geek, you realize how much knowledge about film and love for the work of other greats \u2013 and inspiration from them - went into this (Leone, DePalma, Scorsese and, of course, dozens of hyper-stylized Asian gangster flicks), but to those accusing Tarantino of copying or even &quot;stealing&quot; from other film-makers I can only say: There has never been an artist who adored his kind of art that was NOT inspired or influenced by his favorite artists. And if you watch Tarantino&apos;s masterpiece today, it&apos;s impossible not to recognize just what a breath of fresh air it was (still is, actually). Somehow, movies - especially gangster films - never looked quite the same after &apos;Pulp Fiction&apos;. Probably the most influential film of the last 20 years, it&apos;s got simply everything: amazing performances (especially Sam Jackson); it features some of the most sizzling, iconic dialogue ever written; it has arguably one of the best non-original soundtracks ever - it&apos;s such a crazy, cool, inspirational ride that you feel dizzy after watching it for the first time. It&apos;s \u2013 well: it&apos;s &apos;Pulp Fiction&apos;. 10 stars out of 10.\n\nFavorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/\n\nLesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/\n\nFavorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",

Building on a rich Italian storytelling and film making tradition, with unforgettable score, this movie has justly taken the place it now holds. If you have not seen it yet, do it. Equally subversive and authentic, this is just one master piece nobody should miss.",

      "reviewBody": "When I first saw the trailers for &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring,&quot; I had never had any interest in reading the lengthy tome of a trilogy.  But seeing the possibility of the movie, I immediately went out and read the whole thing, insisted on receiving it for Christmas, and enjoyed every minute of it. The feelings I had while reading the series were heightened seeing it come to life in the stunning movie.  I thought it was a fabulous work of art.\n\nI thought that having Galadriel tell what was basically the prologue of the book was a good idea, as it helped those who had never read the story.  It also immediately involved me in the film; I felt I had an insider&apos;s advantage on the rest of the audience.  Cate Blanchett has a wonderfully deep and emotional voice; the way she speaks Galadriel is almost as effective as her appearence as the Elven queen.  Also, showing the last battle of Isildur and Sauron helped unfog a part of the novel that had me a trifle confused.\n\nThe entire movie is full of beautiful sets and landscapes.  The Shire was almost exactly as I&apos;d pictured it.  Hobbiton is cute and very whimsical. Mordor was frighteningly well done, extremely real.  Rivendell had a little bit of a European-tourist-trap look, but was beautiful all the same.  The entire backdrop of the movie (the mountains, Moria, Isengard) was perfect; it&apos;s amazing that &quot;Fellowship&quot; was filmed in one country.\n\nNow to the characters.  All I can say is, &quot;Wow.&quot;  I was a little apprehensive about the casting at first; I&apos;d created such real images of the characters in my imagination, I almost didn&apos;t want them spoiled for me. However, I was not disapointed in the least.  Elijah Wood, though not one of my favorite actors, was believable.  You could tell from the first glimpse that Frodo was special; Wood&apos;s pale, sharp features contrast sharply with the more ruddy, robust look of the rest of the hobbits.  He also cries like a little girl.  But his weaknesses and strengths make his Frodo an apt choice for the starring character.  The rest of the Hobbiton gang was well-chosen, too.  Sean Astin (&quot;Rudy&quot; forever to me) was loyal and a bit bumbling, just like the Gamgee of Tolkien&apos;s telling.  Pippin and Merry were congenial, slow-witted lads, but very brave nonetheless.  Viggo Mortensen is outstanding.  He has the ability to make Aragorn both menacing and kind. He physically represents Strider to the nines with his strength and virility; the action sequences of his are very passionate and exciting.  Some may have complained about Arwen&apos;s character being slightly expanded; I thought it a good change.  In the books, you have to read the whole trilogy and then rifle through the appendix in &quot;The Return of the King&quot; to learn the history between Aragorn and Arwen.  Liv Tyler is ethereal and breathtaking, but at the same time displays the courage and magic that make the Elves the beings they are.  Speaking of Elves, I can&apos;t help but gush over the handsome and ever-so-talented Orlando Bloom as noble Legolas.  Bloom captured the archer&apos;s very movements; he treads lightly and fights fearlessly. Legolas&apos;s bowmanship was amazing; he looked so natural loosing his arrows machine-gun style.  He was my favorite character in the books, and his essence transcends the film.  Gimli was pompous and brave, as well.  He is well-represented in the movie.  Boromir was hopelessly lost, but at the same time valiant and strong.  Sean Bean gave an emotionally-charged performance as the tortured warrior.  Hugo Weaving was very good as Elrond.  He was noble and cold at the same time.  And Gandalf.  What more can be said of Ian McKellan&apos;s showcase portrayal of the wizard?  He was magnificent.  He could be Gandalf, the kind old conjurer who set off pyrotechnics for hobbit-children.  Then he could turn around and stun the life out of you with Gandalf the powerful wizard, facing the balrog with defiance and an iron will.  His Oscar nomination is well-deserved.\n\nPeter Jackson is a brave soul to take on a project that could have backfired in so many places.  Instead of bringing us uninspired kitsch, he serves up raw emotion, graphic battles of good and evil, chilling and wonderful characters, and enough special effects (realistic, mind you) to make John Cameron&apos;s mouth water.  Knowing that &quot;The Two Towers&quot; was my favorite of the books, I eagerly anticipate the second helping of &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot;"

Like others, I&apos;ve seen this movie more than once. One comment I&apos;ve never heard is that Forrest&apos;s simplicity is almost zen-like. I should read the novel to get the author&apos;s intention (I remember some people preferring the book and complaining that no one at the Academy Awards gave him any credit.) But rather than an implication that you should do what you&apos;re supposed to do and believe in God and you&apos;ll win in the end, I see it as zen-like, i.e., living in the moment and not having expectations or particular cravings (other than his loving Jenny.) So he ends up just stumbling into all the major historical events of the time. Granted, he achieves this only because he doesn&apos;t have the brains to think otherwise and actually have expectations, but so many of our problems are because we do have higher intellect and desires, which ironically makes us unhappy because we know what we are missing. We love our cats and dogs for the same simplicity and always being in the moment. There&apos;s a line in the movie wondering if everything is predestined or happens randomly or it&apos;s a combination of both. It is something to mull over for a long time.",

After 3 hours of sweeping vistas, excellent Shakespearean acting, and otherworldly sights and sounds, we are treated to a scene that still sends chills down my back and rouses me like nothing since the final scene in Rocky. A lone rider (we all know who), set against the top of a hill, massing legions of horsemen behind him. He appears just as the heroes are losing all hope. Once he begins his descent down the hill with his army behind him, the camera begins a slow pan over the top and down with them, showing the size and scale of their forces. The evil army below looks up with surprise, a bright light fills the screen, the camera focuses on the lead rider (again, we all know who) who lets out a wrenching battle cry, the music swells to unbelievable heights, and I am swept away like I&apos;ve never been before.\n\nThis is cinema at its very best.",

      "reviewBody": "In a film like The Empire Strikes Back, especially a few years on the heels of such a mind-bogglingly great film like the original Star Wars, there is something that comes immediately to mind that would at first seem to count against the film, but instead only winds up increasing the respect that it commands. In the 1977 Star Wars, there is a clear reliance on simplicity in some parts. Obviously, it is much more than a simply made science fiction film, but like I said in my review of it, there was a lot of highly effective reliance on things that were not put on screen, such as Obi Wan&apos;s description of The Force to Luke. In The Empire Strike Back, the first thing that we are treated to is the traditional scrolling text along a background of stars, depicting what has happened between the last film and this one, and reminding us of the things that were mentioned in the last film but never explained.\n\nAt first, this would almost seem to be a way to save money to get more information across to the audience without having to actually put it on screen, but this is really an ingenious way of furthering the story. The very fact that we are so willing to read all this information and forgive our inability to actually see it is a testament to the quality of the series, even at this early stage in its presentation, and we know the story so well from the first film that we are glad to see such a large change in what&apos;s happening in the films, not for a second lamenting the fact that we have obviously missed so much action. And besides that, if and when George Lucas runs out of new prequels to release, and maybe if he someday begins to run low on how many hundreds of millions of dollars he has, he could go right back and make these in-between scenes into full length films. What would he call these, if he did that? Introquels? Who cares! The names themselves would be interesting enough, and if you go back and read the stuff that introduces this film, it&apos;s obvious that there&apos;s an entire film there just waiting to be made. I guess the question of actors would be a formidable one, though.\n\nThe Empire Strikes Back is the film where we are first introduced to the great Jedi master Yoda (`Away put your weapon!&apos;), as well as some of the most thrilling battle sequences of the entire Star Wars series, and that includes the prequels. The battle scene where the rebels fight the Imperial Walkers on the ice planet is an incredibly well-made battle scene, not only in the way that it was put together so convincingly using models, but that the machines themselves are so creatively made. Indeed, the Imperial Walkers are some of the most recognizable machines from the entire Star Wars saga, right up there with the Millennium Falcon and the Death Star.\n\n I have just watched this film again, having already seen Episode I and Episode II, and not having seen any of the original Star Wars films for maybe 10 years (except for the original 1977 Star Wars, which I saw and reviewed a few days ago - and these aren&apos;t even the Special Edition versions!). When I first saw Yoda when watching The Empire Strikes Back again, I was really struck by how different he looked from in the newer movies. Obviously, he&apos;s completely computer generated in the new films, but here in Episode V he looks like a muppet! Even so, I would like to express my opinion that Yoda is more realistic and more interesting here as a puppet than in the newer films as a computer generated image. At least here in the older films you know that he&apos;s actually THERE, and that he&apos;s not just added into the film later.\n\nOh yeah, speaking of Yoda, can I just complain for a minute? What the hell was up with the Jedi training? Yes, I realize that I&apos;m just a lowly IMDb reviewer, while The Empire Strikes Back is a part of the greatest science fiction series of all time, but would it have killed George Lucas to write in a little more creative training for Luke? The thing that struck me first about the Star Wars films when I first started watching them was how incredibly imaginative they were, but then Luke started his training. You know, when I was in high school I played football. I was a wide receiver/tight end and I hardly ever got to play because I was too tall and too skinny, but part of my workout was to carry the linemen up and down the stairs to the weight room. Some of these guys weighed 100 pounds more than me, and I still almost never saw the field, and here&apos;s Luke Skywalker. He carries Yoda around this boggy swamp and he gets to be a Jedi! What the hell!\n\nThere is also the addition of a surprisingly fitting love story. First of all, anyone who has ever read my review of a Jerry Bruckheimer movie will know that I am not the biggest fan of cramming a love story into a movie where it doesn&apos;t belong. I can&apos;t seem to write anything about Bruckheimer movies without complaining about the idiot love story, and now it&apos;s even worse because here&apos;s this movie that was made so long before, from which Bruckheimer could obviously have at least learned a LITTLE bit about how to do it right. Han Solo and Princess Leia maintain the personalities that they developed in the first Star Wars film and there is now a sort of love/hate relationship between the two of them, where neither one of them wants to admit their feelings for the other. This romantic subplot is characterized perfectly in the scene just before Solo is carbon frozen, when Leia risks approaching a cheesy romantic moment by saying `I love you&apos; just before Han is lowered into the freezing chamber, and he saves the moment by responding, `I know.&apos; Han Solo. Smart-ass to the last drop.\n\nBefore I end I would like to point out that the goofs that can be found on the IMDb for this film are some of the most blatant that I&apos;ve ever seen in a film. The scene where you can see someone giving a woman at the tactical maps a cue to deliver her lines is amazingly obvious, and some of the other ones, such as the stage hand swinging the light saber prop briefly into view as he switches it for an `off&apos; prop with Luke just after he knocks Darth Vader over backwards, are just as much fun to look for. I have one question about the goofs, though. There&apos;s one where Luke looks off into the fog just after R2-D2 is eaten by the sea monster, and you can CLEARLY see a person running to the right a little ways off in the fog. Is that meant to be Luke? It seems that it&apos;s supposed to be him running in his search for R2, because you can even hear the FOOTSTEPS of the person running. I can&apos;t even IMAGINE how they could have missed THAT!!\n\nIt is, however, a testament to the quality of a film when such tremendous oversights in editing do nothing to take away from the overall quality of the film. The Empire Strikes Back remains an extremely powerful and well-made installment in the Star Wars series, not taking even a single step backwards in the sheer breathtaking adventure of the original film. It&apos;s not often that a film as good as Star Wars can be released and then followed up with a sequel that is just as great, as is clearly the case here. Star Wars was a gigantic film upon its release, and with The Empire Strikes Back, Lucas has begun the formation of one of the greatest film series&apos; in cinematic history.",

      "reviewBody": "Writing a review of The Matrix is a very hard thing for me to do because this film means a lot to me and therefore I want to do the film justice by writing a good review. To tell the truth the first time I saw the film I was enamored by the effects. I remember thinking to myself that this was one of the most visually stunning films I had ever seen in my life. Also having always been a comic book fan and a fan of films that were larger than life, the transitional element of the story was very appealing to me and this probably heightened my enjoyment of the film very much. It wasn&apos;t until some time later (and after having seen the film a few times more) that I started to think about the film. I recognized the Christian elements quite quickly but it wasn&apos;t until I wrote an actual 15-page essay on the film that I tapped into some of the philosophical and religious elements and that made me appreciate the film even more. I won&apos;t say that I have recognized all elements because the film is quite literally packed with them.\n\nActing wise the film works excellently. I won&apos;t say that there aren&apos;t any issues because there are but overall the acting is pretty flawless. Keanu Reeves plays the main character, Neo, or Thomas A. Anderson and while he is not the perfect actor I think he does a pretty good job in The Matrix (and the sequels). He doesn&apos;t have the longest of lines which was probably a deliberate choice from the directors and it works because this gives him a better opportunity to work on posture and facial expressions and I must say that overall his body language is very good. Very clear and well defined. Laurence Fishbourne plays Neo&apos;s mentor Morpheus and he does an excellent job of it. His lines flow with a certain confidence and style that makes his character somewhat unique and interesting. Carrie-Anne Moss does a good job as well and succeeds in looking both cool and sexy in her leather outfit. Joe Pantoliano, a critically underrated actor does a brilliant job of bringing his character, Cypher, to life. I can&apos;t say much about him because his character is pretty essential to the plot and I certainly don&apos;t wan&apos;t to spoil it for anyone. Gloria Foster appears in a relatively small role that will have greater significance in the following films and she does a very good job. The best acting is provided by Hugo Weaving, however, in his portrayal of Agent Smith. It is really something to watch him act out the changes in his character. Agent Smith gains some human traits like anger, sense of dread, hate and eventually even a sly sense of humor (mostly in the sequels). Two thumbs way up to Weaving who has created one of the finest screen villains of all time.\n\nEffects wise the film is simply stunning and it deservedly was awarded the Oscar for best effects (and was regrettably cheated out of a nomination in the Best Film category) ahead of even Star Wars. The reason that I think The Matrix deserves the Oscar for best effects is simply that the effects in The Matrix are more innovative than the ones in Star Wars. Just take a look at how many times the effects have been spoofed and you&apos;ll probably agree. The effects also help in the symbolism of the film and in creating a very dystopian atmosphere not unlike the one seen in Blade Runner and this works brilliantly. The film looks beautiful at all times and today 6 years later (my God has it already been 6 years?) the effects still hold their ground against new science fiction films. Add the effects to the brilliant editing and you have a visual masterpiece on your hands. Very well done.\n\nThe reason that I think The Matrix is more reviewable than pretty much any other film is the story and the philosophical and religious elements of the story because with every viewing I catch something I didn&apos;t see the previous time I watched it. Without spoiling the film I think I can mention a few of the more obvious elements. Obviously the film draws on the Messiah myth as Neo is a clear reference to Jesus with the analogy of his name (Neo = one, as in The One) but also hidden in his other name, Thomas A. Anderson. The first part of his last name, Anderson comes from the Greek Andros meaning &quot;man&quot; and combine this with the second part of his last name &quot;son&quot; and add a little creativity you will come up with the combination &quot;son of man&quot; which was a title Jesus came up with about himself. Also the first time we meet Neo a man calls him (and I quote): &quot;You&apos;re my Saviour man. My own personal Jesus Christ.&quot; It doesn&apos;t get any more obvious than that. Aside from the Christianic elements the film also gets its inspiration from Budhism, Gnosticism (Gnosis = knowledge) but is also inspired by Plato and his analogy of the Cave and Jean Baudrillard&apos;s essay, Simulacra and Simulations. Explaining these elements would make this review go on forever so aside from mentioning them I will not comment on them further.\n\nTo all the people who doubt the profound nature of The Matrix I can only give one advice: Free your mind and watch the film again. You won&apos;t regret it. If I had to choose a favorite all time film my choice would probably fall on either The Matrix (obviously I don&apos;t expect people to agree but if they do thats great) or The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King and I recommend it to all fans of sci-fi and people who like philosophy.\n\n10/10 - on my top 3 of best films.",

      "reviewBody": "&apos;Goodfellas&apos; is a masterpiece, pure and simple. While not my favourite Martin Scorsese movie it is a stunning achievement, and one of his very best movies. The film is stunning technically. The consistently fine acting by the large ensemble cast (both known and unknown), the cinematography, editing, dialogue, brilliant use of music, it&apos;s all breathtaking. But Scorsese and co-writer Mitch Pileggi never lose lose sight of their main goal - to tell a story. And in that it&apos;s really hard to beat this movie. As to the actors De Niro is on top form, Ray Liotta is the best he&apos;s ever been, and this is Joe Pesci&apos;s definitive performance. Plus you have Lorraine Bracco, Paul Sorvino, Michael Imperioli, and lots of well known faces in small but important roles (Debi Mazar, Samuel L. Jackson, Illeana Douglas, Kevin Corrigan), plus dozens of unfamiliar actors (and non-actors) who are all so good it seems unfair just to single out the &quot;stars&quot;. (Also keep an eye out for Vincent Gallo in a few scenes. He has no lines, but looks cool!). &apos;Goodfellas&apos; is (to date) Scorsese&apos;s last Great Movie, and one of the very best films of the 1990s. Absolutely essential viewing for any movie fan, this tremendous film is not to be missed! Highly recommended!"

      "reviewBody": "Set in the early 60s, the story involves R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) and his arrival at a mental institution in Salem, Oregon (where the film was shot). He plays the &quot;mental illness&quot; card to get out of prison time, thinking it&apos;ll be a piece of cake, but he&apos;s wrong, very wrong. Everything appears well at the hospital and Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) seems to be a benevolent overseer of McMurphy&apos;s ward, but there are sinister things going on beneath the surface.\n\n&quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&apos;s Nest&quot; (1975) is a film you&apos;ll appreciate more as you mature. I saw it when I was younger and, while I thought it was good, I didn&apos;t &apos;get&apos; a lot of the insights the film conveys.\n\nThe movie criticizes the way institutions deal with mental illnesses. Their &quot;therapy&quot; is futile and only makes the patients dependent on the institution itself, thereby creating its need for existence (often at the taxpayer&apos;s expense). McMurphy is a threat to the establishment and therefore must be &quot;dealt with.&quot;\n\nA lot of people criticize the film by suggesting that Nurse Ratched &quot;isn&apos;t that bad&quot; or that &quot;she was only trying to do her job&quot;, etc. I had the same reaction the first couple of times I saw it. This reveals an aspect of the film&apos;s brilliance: Ratched&apos;s malevolence is so subtle that the filmmakers allow the possibility for complete misinterpretation. Yes, from an administrative point of view, she seemingly does a good job, she&apos;s authoritarian without being sadistic, and she cares for the residents as long as they follow the rules (more on this below). Yet she is demonic as a robotized arm of a dehumanizing system. She maintains the residents in a state of oblivion and marginalization; they are deprived of their dignity because the system sees them as subhuman.\n\nThe filmmakers and Fletcher (not to mention the author of the book, Ken Kesey) make Nurse Ratched a more effective antagonist by showing restraint. Compare her to, say, Faye Dunaway&apos;s portrayal of Joan Crawford in &quot;Mommie Dearest,&quot; which pretty much turned her into a cartoon villain. Ratched isn&apos;t such an obvious sadist, yet she uses the rules to tyrannize the men and reduce them to an almost infantile state of dependency and subservience. Her crowning achievement is Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif).\n\nMcMurphy, despite his obvious flaws, is the protagonist of the story. Although he&apos;s impulsive and has a weakness for the female gender, which got him into prison in the first place, he has a spirit of freedom and life. His problem is that he needs to learn a bit of wisdom; then he can walk in his freedom without causing unnecessary harm to himself and others.\n\nNurse Ratched, on the other hand, represents legal-ism, which is an authoritarian spirit obsessed with laws or rules. This is clearly seen in the World Series sequence: Even though McMurphy gets the final vote he needs for his ward to watch the Series Ratched refuses to allow it on a technicality. When McMurphy then PRETENDS to watch the game and works the guys up into a state of euphoria, Ratched reacts with sourpuss disapproval. That&apos;s because legalism is the opposite of the spirit of freedom, life and joy. Legalism is all about putting on appearances and enforcing the LETTER of the law (rule). The problem with this is that &quot;appearances&quot; are not about inward reality and, worse, &quot;the letter kills.&quot;\n\nDespite his folly and mistakes, McMurphy does more good for the guys in his ward than Ratched and the institution could do in a lifetime. How so? Not only because he has a spirit of freedom and life, but because he loves deeply, but only those who deserve it - the humble - not arrogant abusers. When you cast restraint to the wind and love with all your heart you&apos;ll reap love in return, as long as the person is worthy. A certain person hugs McMurphy at the end because he loves him. McMurphy set him free from the shackles of mental illness and, worse, the institution that refuses to actually heal because it needs mentally ill people to exist; it only goes through the motions of caring and healing (not that there aren&apos;t any good people in such institutions, of course).\n\nNo review of this film is complete without mentioning the notable character of &quot;Chief&quot; Bromden, played effectively by Will Sampson.\n\nThe film runs 2 hours and 13 minutes.\n\nGRADE: A",

      "reviewBody": "Though its biblical connotation is not the happiest one (&quot;Seven Deadly Sins&quot;) number seven, omnipresent in our (7 days a) weekly cycles, seems to have been a lucky number in the world of cinema. Several very solid and some great movies have this number in their title, starting with gag-wise incredibly inventive Seven Chances (1925) from genius of silent era Buster Keaton, Frank Borzage&apos;s silent version of classic melodrama 7th Heaven (1927), Walt Disney&apos;s first feature-length animated movie, Snowhite and Seven Dwarfs (1940), recognized as an instant classic and remained so ever after, Stanley Donen&apos;s ear-pleasing, eye-riveting musical Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954), staged in western milieu, with the breathtaking barn-raising dance sequence, Ingmar Bergman&apos;s literally Death-defying, answers-to-reasons-for-human-misfortune-seeking masterpiece, Det sjunde inseglet (&quot;The Seventh Seal&quot;) (1957), Billy Wilder&apos;s Seven Year Itch (1957), a clever and amusing first collaboration with incomparable Marilyn Monroe (a worm-up for their second, bigger if not decisive step in taboos-of-the-motion-picture-production-code-breaking, brilliant comedy Some Like It Hot (1959)), up to newer examples like David Fincher&apos;s disturbing drama Se7en (1995), one of the finest Hollywood movies of the 90&apos;s, as well as Tsui Hark&apos;s Chat Gim (&quot;Seven Swords&quot;) (2005), a stunner in the department of action sequences from the often under-appreciated genre Wuxia, originating from Chinese literature.\n\nHowever, even among such illustrious examples of movie-making par excellence, one movie holds a special place, Shichinin no samurai (&quot;Seven Samurai&quot;) (1954) from the legendary Japanese director Akira Kurosawa. This movie doesn&apos;t seem to lack anything that an avid movie consumer, in particular samurai genre admirer, might be wishing for.\n\nIt is not easy to say anything new about the one of the most analyzed and scrutinized movies of the film history. Nevertheless, and despite being eventually only repeated, it shall be mentioned that movie has a simple but very engaging story - a group of peasants, representing a village, periodically stormed by gang of bandits, looting their crops and other possessions, hires several wandering ronins (masterless samurai) to help them protect the village - not without lucid observations on the possibility of social interaction between members of different classes during the almost seven centuries long feudal history (1185-1868) of Japan.\n\nCharacterization is excellent, and though having clear stand-outs in samurai&apos;s true leader, Kambei (Takashi Shimura), a wise tactician of the exceptional valor, as well as in the exuberantly uncontrollable Kikuchiyo (Toshiro Mifune), messy in its appearance and blustering in its manner, yet, a peasant descendant himself, making for a perfect link between the samurai and their employers, all other samurai are memorable, as well, sporting wide variety of personality traits. In joining the village protection campaign, hired for nothing more than a regular meal for as long as providing a service, thus primarily hoping to finally fill their starving stomachs, each one of them was driven by different additional motives, whether they were challenged to test their bravery, fighting skills and tactics, seeking for excitement and recognition, trying to regain pride and glory of the past days, just reaching out for that human touch (cross-class communication, even mere courtship promising relationship) they have been deprived of, or simply interested in its noble cause.\n\nTogether with true highlights in realistically choreographed battle scenes, showing all the pain and misery of excessive violence on the reverse of heroism, that even defenders cannot avoid resorting to, sadly announcing inevitable decline of the samurai and their ways exposed to new artless technology, unbecomingly dying ambushed by distant shots from the muskets, while ingloriously stuck in the village muds... it all makes for a compelling narrative.\n\nThough triumphant in their common task to protect the village, unlikely alliance between samurai and peasants is ultimately doomed to fail. In the short run, it gives expected results, but in the long run, does not stand the chance. That is so loudly, although in fact silently, expressed at the end, when peasants don&apos;t even care to join the surviving samurai in their mourning over the fallen ones, not even giving the last well deserved respect to those who have helped them withstand fierce attacks, prevail and ultimately defeat bandits, and, in doing so, most of them given their lives. Peasants simply continue with their daily chores, while surviving samurai have to leave the village, like they have never existed, sadly symbolizing their ultimate destiny: slowly but surely stepping off the future pages of the history books.\n\nSeven Samurai, the movie, is rightfully considered as the one that has redefined samurai film in its contemporary perception, and dawned almost two decades long string of successes, instantly becoming the brightest example of thus revived, uniquely provocative and entertaining sub-genre, unknown as such in the country of its origin, classified there within a broader genre, jidaigeki (a period drama, often describing events from pre-modern era of the Edo period, marking the governance of Tokugawa shogunate (1603-1868), relatively peaceful times for Japan&apos;s long history of civil wars, as opposed to gendaigeki, films treating contemporary matters), and by IMDb standards, as an action drama, occasionally historical, when based on real events.\n\nOriginating in the Edo-era Far East, it has inspired equally successful, star-studded (Y. Brynner, S. McQueen, C. Bronson, J. Coburn, E. Wallach, R. Vaughn, H. Buchholz, B. Dexter) Hollywood remake, The Magnificent Seven (1960), conveniently situated in the U.S. West of 19th century, as well as three lesser sequels, Return of... (1966), Guns of... (1969), and ...Ride! (1972).",

      "reviewBody": "This movie is from start to finish a well produced and directed film.  The performances in this movie are outstanding. Brad Pitt, once again, makes his role a stand-out performance by putting his versatile acting skills into his interpretation of Detective David Mills. Morgan Freeman is well-cast. His brooding acting style fits the character (Detective William Somerset) like a glove, and Gwyneth Paltrow gives her best performance EVER in the role of Brad Pitt&apos;s supportive wife/lover (Tracy Mills). And of course, Kevin Spacey who plays the diabolical yet misunderstood serial killer.\n\nThe movie is suspenseful and in parts very exciting.  There is a &quot;Pseudo-Noir&quot; quality to this movie that really fits in well with the content of the film (Serial Killing). It has it&apos;s philosophical moments that anyone who thinks a lot about the state of the world today can appreciate. It makes subtle moral judgements without insulting any beliefs that the viewer may have and it also generates debate for any post-film coffee/drinks gathering.\n\nAndrew Kevin Walker (Screenplay) has taken the subject of the Seven Deadly Sins and he really puts a great new twist on these themes.  As a writer, I really could appreciate the depth that he goes into with these ideas. The movie gives us just enough information to be entertained and informed yet not bombarded and made bored with too much philosophy.  In this respect, the film doesn&apos;t &quot;preach&quot; any special meaning even though the film&apos;s moral statements are still maintained.  This film can be enjoyed on so many levels and I really enjoyed the third act. One of the best pieces of storytelling and scriptwriting ever.\n\nOutstanding performances from everyone involved (And yes, of course, David Fincher does a wonderful job) Say no more. *****",

There are some little gems in life that help make life pleasant. It is not officially the Christmas season without watching this little gem. The supporting cast is perfectly matched. Donna Reed is wonderful as well as all the characters of the town. This would be a great movie, even if it were not in a Christmas setting. The holiday flavor makes it even more charming and memorable. A angel trying to get his wings is a little far-fetched, but Capra pulls it off. The impact of living a good life cannot be underestimated. What would life be like for your family if you had never been born? Our actions do speak loudly. In an age of 9-11, we need this movie more than ever. The values of &quot;It&apos;s A Wonderful Life&quot; still hold true today. Yes, I&apos;ll say it, it&apos;s a wonderful movie.",

      "reviewBody": "The first time I saw the movie was when I was about seventeen or so, and I never forgot it. The incredibly human characters (such as the doctor who loved riddles), the fantastic script-writing, the amazing acting, and of course the heartwarming story. This movie proves once and for all how strong we are, as humans, that in the face of adversity we can make the best of things. There is so much love in the characters; Dora&apos;s love for her husband Guido is boundless, as well as Guido&apos;s love for his son. Sure, it&apos;s a slightly unrealistic movie, but hey, aren&apos;t they all a little unrealistic? I&apos;ve also seen people review this movie and say that it made light of the Holocaust, which was of course a dark point in history. I don&apos;t think so; I think that it&apos;s only delicately handled, and because of that, the movie is one that a person can watch in one sitting without being thoroughly disgusted by mankind. I would say that those who think this movie is too &quot;light&quot; are cynical and bitter. The whole point to the movie is to show what love is capable of, and to provide encouragement and perhaps guidance. This movie changed my life from the first time I watched it. I came away with this feeling that no matter what I have to face in life, that I can overcome it. This is a movie that I would recommend to anyone over the age of eleven. The acting is superb (though Roberto Benigni is a little over-the-top, LOL), the story heartwarming and easy to understand. It&apos;s excellent!",

      "reviewBody": "My grandfather fought in WW2 somehow surviving D-Day. He was apart of Operation Neptune and stormed the beaches of Normandy. He told us a lot of war stories but rarely ever spoke about that day. Before he passed away he did an interview with a local newspaper and detailed what he saw despite it being very difficult for him to speak about. He loved watching war movies... not sure exactly why. Some about that soldier life never really leaves them I guess. He absolutely hated Pearl Harbor cause of the horrible way they portray the military to be a bunch of toothbrush wielding babies who don&apos;t know what to do in the event of being attacked. He had a friend stationed there who lost his life and thinks that movie is a disgusting display of ignorance. Soldiers don&apos;t take girlfriends on private plane rides. And they most definitely know how to swim. Maybe I&apos;ll give that movie a good ripping one day.\n\nBut Saving Private Ryan was a respectable &quot;I can&apos;t watch this&quot; reaction. He said no movie has come that close to capturing what that day was like. He said it was too realistic. Whether or not the story is based on real or fiction, that intro was 100% realistic. I&apos;m not sure if he ever did finish watching it but he appreciated it for capturing that chaos like no other movie has before. I watched the movie a dozen times now and keep it in my collection as a reminder of my grandfather. A scene he was technically in. Which makes me appreciate how strong of a person he really is.\n\nWar is hell and this movie not only shows that while being an entertaining experience but also captured what soldiers are left behind with. My grandfather was not afraid of anything. I&apos;ve seen this man walk into a cellar full of black widows to get firewood and not even shake them off. The only time he ever experienced fear was when he went to bed. His nightmares of his time during the war would haunt him in his sleep. This movie helped me understand why.",

Today it is probable that pc games will offer a deeper and more satisfying entertainment solution, but for pure visual and aural pleasure, mixed with basic emotional manipulation, there has never and will never be a better example of cinema than when star wars appeared over 25 years ago. When you think of star wars, you must remember what else was happening at the time. In America, the war in Vietnam had been lost. In the U.K economic disaster was occurring(a 3 day working week, and the army collecting rubbish). It was almost like the two most technically advanced countries in the world were going backwards. Star wars let everybody escape from that reality and reach for a future that was uncertain but ultimately good.",

I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan and this movie was his finest. Matthew McConaughey turned in his best performance of his lifetime. Anne Hathaway was an amazing supporting actress and compared to her performance in Les Miserables, I have no idea how she didn&apos;t get an Oscar for this. The visual effects were more than just Oscar worthy. They were pioneering. I have never seen anything like it. One thing I would recommend is having a little previous knowledge about space. Not like Einstein stuff though. I would recommend you see this movie as fast as you can if you are a Nolan fan or not. I give this movie a rating of 97 out of 100.",

The least I can say about it is that there was not a single moment during it that my attention wasn&apos;t completely focused. The plot was fantastic and full-bodied. Each character was given so much personality, even the little soot spiders weren&apos;t treated as two-dimensional.\n\nIn a way the whole film felt like a dream, in that it is seamless. It flows, effortlessly, from scene to scene, from emotion to emotion - straight from terror and tragedy to comedy - without the subtle bump that wakes you up, that lets you know that the makers of the movie and the creator of the script had wanted you to be crying but now you really should be laughing. It was so LIFELIKE. Sometimes in real life the most grim moments contain honest elements of comedy that do not seem out-of-place. But trying to put that sort of convoluted emotion into a film creates a very thin line that too many have fallen off of.\n\nThere was no part of the film that felt fake, or rushed, or shaky; the intensity of the story line and the determination of the lead character was obvious throughout. More than causing interest, this movie made me FEEL. I was sucked into the drama. I can rarely say that a movie made me laugh and cry without feeling like an idiot, but the caliber of this picture is so high that I don&apos;t even feel embarrassed. I laughed. I cried. And you will too.",

Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan were wonderful and the supporting cast was fantastic.\n\nBased on a serial novel by Stephen King, the Green Mile is about Paul Edgecomb, a officer in charge of prisoners on death row and everything was the same as usual until the day that John Coffey (Clarke Duncan) was brought to the mile.  Coffey is an extraordinary person and Paul Edgecomb never believed in miracles until the day he met one.  \n\nThis movie is one of the best adaptations of a Stephen King novel that I have ever seen.  I think that I would recommend this movie to everyone, and even if you don&apos;t like King&apos;s work I am certain that you will love this flick.  This movie was robbed at the Academy Awards, but never the less, it is still one of the most memorable movies I have ever seen.  A small warning though, if you are a bit squeemish then you may need to hide your eyes for a few scenes, but don&apos;t miss out on this movie because of it.  I give this movie a 9.5 out of 10!!!"

      "name": "Samurai Genre is Used to Exposively Indict Japanese Politics and Culture",
      "reviewBody": "I saw Harakiri (Seppuku) in a new 35 mm print at NYC&apos;s Film Forum. This is a brilliant use of a narrow period genre to explosively indict politics and culture. Writers Shinobu Hashimoto and Yasuhiko Takiguchi surely must have been as inspired by &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo,&quot; Ambrose Bierce and Howard Hawks&apos; Westerns as much as by samurai literature and movies.\n\nThe film begins deceptively as a story within a story, seemingly providing a traditional example of upholding samurai honor, such as in the conventional, oft-retold tale of &quot;The 47 Ronin.&quot; The context is set at a time when the central government, the shogunate, is supplanting local clans and arbitrarily unemploying thousands of people, notably their samurai, forcing them into the mercenary mode of ronin at best and begging for food at worse. But the parallels to the 20th century are made repeatedly explicit as the samurai who comes to this clan seeking help is from Hiroshima.\n\nVery gradually we get further insight on the tale within a tale, as we see more flashbacks within flashbacks into what each character has been doing before these confrontations and we get uneasy inklings that the moral of the story may not be what it appears at first and the stakes get higher and higher with almost unbearable tension.\n\nIt is almost halfway through the film until we see a female and we suddenly see an alternative model of masculinity, where a priority is put on family, support, education and creative productivity. In comparison to the macho opening relationships, with their emphasis on formal militaristic loyalty to a hierarchy, a loving husband and father is practically a metrosexual. Seeing the same stalwart samurai making casual goo goo sounds to his grandbaby puts the earlier, ritualized scenes in sharp relief, particularly the recurring image of the clan&apos;s armor which seems less and less imposing and is finally destroyed as an empty symbol.\n\nThe psychological tension in the confrontations in the last third of the film is more excruciating than the actual violence. Even when we thought we already knew the outcome from the flashbacks, the layers of perception of relationships and personalities are agonizingly peeled away with each thrust of a sword to reveal the depths of the horrifying hypocrisy of the political and social structure. And those are just the overwhelming cultural resonances that a 21st century American can glean. Like &quot;Downfall (Der Untergang),&quot; it reveals the inhumane mentality that led to World War II.\n\nThe repeating motif of long walks then confrontations down empty corridors emphasizes the stultifying bureaucratic maze that entraps the characters. The revenge motifs are accented by startlingly beautiful cinematography that recalls traditional Japanese art, including drops of blood like first snow flakes then a waterfall.\n\nThe over all effect of this masterpiece is emotionally draining.",

      "reviewBody": "I remember seeing &quot;Schindler&apos;s list&quot; about ten years ago, and I remember how weird I felt for being almost completely unmoved by it. Although it showed the horrors of holocaust quite realistically, somehow it all seemed just a bit too fake and exaggerated. Characters were a bit off (I still can&apos;t decide who was more over the top, Schindler or Goeth), fake sentimentalism was all over the place, . While it was a work of art and an important reminder of true events that shouldn&apos;t be forgotten, on emotional level it just somehow failed to deliver.\n\nEnter &quot;The Pianist&quot;. With no Spielberg around to put his trademark sappy material, we finally have a movie that shows the true horror and tragedy of Jewish people in World War II. The story is told through the eyes of one man - Wladislaw Szpielman, Jewish pianist who works in a radio station in Warsaw during the German occupation of Poland. Together with him we watch his world getting torn apart, witness his family being taken away, his existence being reduced to bare essentials. Brody gives a subtle yet spectacular performance, his best work yet. And never once are we reminded that we are watching a movie. Everything is shown from Szpielman&apos;s point of view, and it is all very gritty and realistic. While Spielberg&apos;s rendition of German atrocities always had a slightly staged feel to augment their dramatic purpose, here they are so true to life there impact is much greater - you watch and are being reminded in horror that this things actually happened.\n\nWhile being very hard to watch sometimes, this is a movie that &quot;Schindler&apos;s List&quot; was supposed to be. This movie doesn&apos;t judge anybody, or tries to explain anything - it shows historical events as a reflection of one man&apos;s fate, making a powerful testimony that stays with you long after the beautiful last shot and the end credits are over.",

      "name": "the best action film of all time, and NOT due to the CGI",
      "reviewBody": "Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers arthouse-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you&apos;re not able to take a few sci-fi leaps of faith, ignore this review, as well. We&apos;ll both be better off.\n\nThis is the finest action movie of all time. And, yet, believe it or not, it&apos;s not the action in the film itself that makes this be the case. This is especially odd in a movie with a $100 million budget (in 1991!), with multiple huge explosions, with thousands of bullets fired, and scores of stuntmen used.\n\nThis movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth, and realizes them almost perfectly with all the tools that fit the task -- actors, stunts, puppetry, models, and CG. Without the vision, this film would be nothing. Without the tools, this film would be nothing.\n\nBut, a little bit of background is due. This is the sequel to the Terminator (1984), whose premise was that a near-indestructible cyborg is sent by evil self-aware machines from the near future to destroy the mother-to-be of the military commander who would lead the humans to a victory over the machines. Oh, and this terminator machine would come from a time of war between men and machines which followed a nuclear exchange that left billions of people dead, first. In Terminator 2, John Connor (the commander-to-be) is about 12 years old, and his mother (Sarah) is feverishly trying to prepare him for his fate, even as she tries to stop the factors that will lead to the nuclear war and the entire terrible future that made all this necessary. The machines now send a superior, more intelligent, shape-shifting cyborg (T1000) into the past, to kill John himself. Meanwhile, future-John reprograms the ex-evil Terminator (T101) from the original film, and sends him into the past to PROTECT John against the T1000.\n\nThat&apos;s your basic plot. It does involve travel into the past, so it immediately presents a time-travel paradox which can&apos;t really be resolved. In order to even try watching this movie, you MUST LOOK PAST THE PARADOX. If you don&apos;t, this movie has zero credibility, and is not worth your time.\n\nWhat happens after the two terminators appear in the past is a wild ride rife with macho action, dark reflection on the nature of man, and a few rays of hope, here and there. Schwarzenegger (the good terminator) and Patrick (the bad one) make for such effective foes that the times they meet on-screen are completely breathtaking (and odd, given that you repeatedly see the relatively slim T1000 through Arnie through a wall or two). Hamilton, as Sarah Connor, is a wonderful character -- tough beyond all belief and completely focussed on preventing the nuclear war and ensuring John&apos;s safety, yet clearly a little out of her mind with paranoia and anger; amazingly, you see actual character development (specifically, when John and T101 arrive at Dyson&apos;s house to prevent her from doing what she wants to) in her otherwise 2-dimensional character. And Furlong, as John, is not bad himself as the extroverted kid who&apos;s confused by the fact that everyone except his mom tell him his entire upbringing was based on a lie. The bit players all do their jobs well, particularly Earl Boen who plays the semi-sadistic mental hospital warden that stands between Sarah Connor and her son (until the T1000 makes a chilling entrance).\n\nWith these players set in motion, it&apos;s up to the script to deliver the real substance of the movie. (One often sees great performances in mediocre films... here the story transcends the performances -- an impressive feat.) The script delivers. The film is absolutely filled with great, classic moments (I counted TEN all-star ones during my last viewing), and they&apos;re evenly spaced through the movie. I mean, who doesn&apos;t cheer (at least inside) when Arnold steps out of the biker bar, fully clad in leather when &quot;Bad to the Bone&quot; music starts to blast? The guy absolutely bleeds coolness. And the T1000 absolutely bleeds evil. But, with so many great moments, you&apos;d think the pacing would be a little uneven... not really! The film shifts from place to place with an ease that makes perfect sense, never giving you the time to start being a little nitpicking jerk, always driving forward, but always doing so thoughtfully and with attention to detail.\n\nOf course, this wouldn&apos;t be an action movie without some action. There&apos;s plenty of it, and it&apos;s perfectly done. The CG effects for the shape-shifting T1000 were cutting-edge for the time, and still look great (whoever said differently below is simply incorrect) -- even if they&apos;re completely commonplace today. The stunts are completely insane in scale (at one point, a helicopter flies under a highway overpass; at another, a motorcycle jumps from the 2nd floor of a building into a flying chopper). (Probably, only the Matrix and the Lord of the Rings movies compare in terms of the level of stunt insanity.) And the gunplay is delivered in perfect Cameron-Schwarzenegger style (as opposed to the slo-mo John Woo-style) -- you&apos;ll see lots of heavy automatic and explosive weapons, and you&apos;ll see them used well. The film is violent, and somewhat bloody, but ALL of the mean-spirited violence is dealt by the evil characters, not the ones you root for (Quentin Tarantino fans: sorry). And then the truly amazing scenes that bypass acting are shocking and memorable -- just wait until the nuclear detonation sequence.\n\nI&apos;m not sure what else you would want in a movie. Probably moral content, and the movie has a very clear pro-human, anti-war message. The message is a bit stale, and the delivery IS, at times, a little heavy-handed (and some moments with the T101 seem just a bit unrealistic, towards the end), but the movie has heart, and that you cannot deny. Plus, it simply rocks. 10/10",

This generation&apos;s &quot;It&apos;s a Wonderful Life&quot;?  Think about it.  Very popular and very entertaining sci-fi comedy that made Fox a movie star after success with tv&apos;s &quot;Family Ties&quot;, casting him, after Eric Stoltz was dropped, as Marty McFly who winds up in a nuclear-powered DeLorean time-machine and is sent back in time to 1955 by his quintessentially eccentric friend Dr. Emmet Brown (Lloyd doing a fine Art Carney).  There he meets up with his parents to be and realizes his chance encounters have changed his future and he must see history repeat itself or perish.  High-concept hilarity and some truly ingenious schematics thanks to screenwriter Bob Gale and director Bob Zemeckis.  Wondering what it would be like to never be born and/or what it would be like if things were different...see what I mean.  Oscar-nominated song &quot;The Power of Love&quot; by Huey Lewis (who has a fun cameo) fuels this dynamo gem of a film.  Classic."

      "reviewBody": "Out of the mind of Christorpher McQurrie comes this incredible story of a man in search of the devil. The film is called &quot; The Usual Suspects&quot; and what could be more appropriate than an unusual movie about five suspects who are anything but usual. The story originates with the only survivor of what the police conclude was a murderous and explosive drug deal gone bad. His name is Roger Kint (Kevin Spacey is perfect) also known as &apos;Verbal.&apos; From the mouth of this innocent storytelling, con-artist comes the fantastic tale of how he and his fellow criminals, Stephen Baldwin, is Michael McManus, Benicio Del Toro is Fred Fenster and Kevin Pollak as Todd Hockney were originally assembled and then set-up. Beginning with a mix-up by law enforcement to put several guilty men together in the same line up, the tale proceeds cross country and culminates with a powerful, but mysterious kingpin by the name of Keyser Soze. It&apos;s through his attorney, Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite), the men learn they are marked for death unless they undertake a dangerous assignment. The center piece of the Unusual group is their leader, a remarkable individual named Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne, incredible performance). What transpires in this movie from moment to moment is a lesson in sleigh of hand. What we and the police Dave Kujan, (Chazz Palminteri) are told is not what we see. Conversely, what we see is not what we have been told. In the end, this film with it&apos;s haunting theme by John Ottman, is nothing short of incredible. A superb classic in both mystery and action entertainment, by Bryan Singer. A great film indeed. ****",

      "name": "It&apos;s the Little Things",
      "reviewBody": "So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie&apos;s cumulative power. It&apos;s often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:\n\na.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn&apos;t a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.\n\nb.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane&apos;s fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don&apos;t want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion&apos;s last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.\n\nc.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, &quot;I&apos;m in no mood for trouble&quot;, to the final &quot;hey!&quot; just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn&apos;t right, but the problem isn&apos;t with the car lot; it&apos;s Marion&apos;s plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.\n\nd.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (&quot;Sometimes just once is enough&quot;, in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she&apos;s saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.\n\ne.) The sheriff&apos;s house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates&apos; death (and the dress she was buried in, &quot;periwinkle blue&quot;). John McInyre&apos;s sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, &quot;Well if that&apos;s Mrs. Bates in the window, who&apos;s that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary&quot;.\n\nf.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective&apos;s interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman&apos;s voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.\n\ng.) The shrink&apos;s explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman&apos;s pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn&apos;t stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.\n\n In conclusion I&apos;d like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",

Excellent criticism of the Taylorism/capitalistic through humor relevant for any age, nationality or time; story-telling that would touch anyone alike in a universal fashion, every now and then sparkled with Chaplin&apos;s unique and deeply influential sense of humor and on-screen comedy. Hilarious in moments, and unique. A man of many talents clearly, and excellent at those. Overall this depicts quite a zany approach to life, one that is pure in essence and profoundly antagonistic with the current ways of the time, and ways of today still: a life dominated by one-track thinking, rigid and stubborn social etiquette, and the enslavement this new world has brought in so many aspects to the human species. Finally, it highlights the importance of never giving up; EVER; and the preciousness of love.",

      "reviewBody": "This film proves without any doubt that animation isn&apos;t just suited to tales of fantasy, sci-fi or cartoon comedy and violence. This absolutely heartbreaking Japanese anime tells the story of a young boy, Seito and his younger sister, Setsuko, as they attempt to survive the American bombings on Japan in the last year of World War II.\n\nThe story itself, based on a true story, is powerful enough but the decision to animate the film truly elevates this film to a higher level. This would have been a powerful enough live action drama, along the lines of Spielberg&apos;s Empire of the Sun or even Schindler&apos;s List. However, the Studio Ghibli team, have brought an extraordinary amount of life to all the characters, but especially the young siblings. Now we&apos;re not talking realism as such here - the characters are in no way photo-realistic, they do have the usual characteristics of Japanese anime humans, large eyes and exaggerated expressions. What this achieves however is a heightened level of subtle nuances in expression which are arguably more powerful and provocative than anything a real-life actor may achieve. Some may claim this is overly manipulative or sentimental, but coupled with the characters movements and actions, it gives the characters such a strong, and very human, presence. You truly care for these kids, which is an astonishing achievement. The voice cast (original Japanese) contributes significantly here also.\n\nIt is the tiny moments which give this film so much power and emotional depth - from subtle expressions to brief scenes showing Seito playing with his sister at bath time, attempting, unsuccessfully, to cheer her up when she misses her mother. The painted backgrounds are works of art in themselves, just beautiful. And of course the scenes with the fireflies bring a touch of pure magic - a heightened innocent reality to contrast the horrific realities of the war.\n\nThe greatest achievement of this film is that, apart from a couple of obviously sentimental scenes, such as Setsuko&apos;s sobbing or illness, it doesn&apos;t force any false emotion on the viewer. It really comes from your involvement with the characters. It&apos;s completely honest to it&apos;s own story and even cuts off scenes abruptly, which could potentially have been milked for cheap sentiment. It often seems to say - This is what happened, you don&apos;t need to see anymore. Another of it&apos;s strengths is that it really doesn&apos;t comment on the politics of the war in any way, just the effects on innocent people.\n\nThis is an intensely moving film and a masterpiece of animation. If you aren&apos;t moved by these characters, you really need to check your pulse. 10/10",

So if you want to stop doing evil actions, you also have to stop seeing evil because to see evil you must project evil... therefore, you create evil. If you genuinely want to be moral, you got to make a counterintuitive move of giving up all morality. All of your moral rules give them all away. Only then you will truly be moral but if you go around touting your morality, and telling people how moral you are and how immoral they are, that immediately tells that you&apos;re not embodying your morality. A genuinely moral person would never do that because true morality is not based on rules, it&apos;s not a self-image that you adopt, it&apos;s not a list of 10 commandments that you follow. When you think you&apos;re so righteous and so moral, you will go and kill people in the name of your morality which is precisely what creates evil.",

Our protagonist has a dream of being a great drummer, a drummer that will be remembered forever. Maybe you are still fighting for your dream. Maybe you have given up on greatness. Greatness doesn&apos;t come easily, you need to practice at it. Andrew practices until his hands bleed.\n\nAndrew (Miles Teller) is 19-year old student at a music conservatory in Manhattan. Terrence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons) is a teacher at the conservatory with a ruthlessly brutal teaching style. After picking Andrew to play in the school band, he pushes Andrew to his limits in order to realize his full potential, at the risk of his humanity.\n\nI had a billiards teacher at one point in my life, who was close to becoming a pro in his craft but a grease fire accident changed all that. His perspective changed, to paraphrase, he realized he was becoming an asshole. He became a teacher of pool instead of becoming a pro player. Through him, I can understand what Terrence Fletcher was trying to instill into Andrew. My teacher would push me a little bit. When he gave me opportunities to show him up, &quot;run the table now,&quot; he would tell me, I failed. It&apos;s embarrassing when that happens but it&apos;s also a learning tool because more work needs to be done. You can&apos;t get by on talent alone but it certainly helps. On the other side of it, I saw a little bit of my teacher in Andrew. Losing who you are to perfect something you love. Good thing my teacher realized before it was too late.\n\nI lost myself in the story. It had something to say about not settling and asking more of yourself. Two fantastic performances from Miles Teller and J.K. Simmons. Perhaps it will push you to maybe pick up that guitar again, put on your ballet shoes, or hit the gym to bulk up. Whiplash is an incredibly powerful film. And after the final shot cuts to black, the film will stick with you for days.\n\nMy expectations: Medium. I did not expect the film to be so powerful for me. Expectations exceeded.\n\nRecommendation: Cinema lovers and casual movie goers, I believe will enjoy this film.\n\nRe-watch value: I can watch this film again and I actually can&apos;t wait until it hits distribution.\n\nMemorable: I am still thinking about this film.",

      "reviewBody": "The epic blockbuster returns with the 21st Century&apos;s answer to Cecil B DeMille, Ridley Scott and his dramatic tale of courage and revenge, GLADIATOR - &quot;the general who became a slave, the slave who became a gladiator, the gladiator who defied an emperor&quot;.\n\nOnce a great roman General, and as good as adopted son of Marcus Aurelius Caesar (Harris), Maximus (Crowe) is forced into exile by Commodus (Phoenix), heir to the throne, after the death of Marcus. Saved from death by slavers, he is purchased for use as a gladiator by Proximo (Reed) and ends up in the arena of all arena&apos;s, the Colloseum, where he proves unbeatable under his guise as &quot;The Spaniard&quot;.\n\nAnd with a budget of over $100m, Scott certainly delivers the goods. GLADIATOR transcends the notion of &apos;blockbuster&apos; that we have become accustomed to in the age of electronic and special effects wizardry and instead offers a good old fashioned action film along the lines of Spartacus and and Ben Hur. Not only are we drawn into an archetypal story that contains all the classic elements a filmgoer could dream of (love, loss, courage, despair, good triumphing over evil etc etc) - also on offer is a visual feast of cinematic painting after painting - a rich tapestry of images that are breathtaking and ultimately visually satisfying. From the plains of Germania, to the desert stronghold of Zuchobar, and finally to great Rome herself, John Mathiesion, the cinematographer is to be commended highly for his general inventiveness and ability to capture so much on film. The opening  battle scene is superb as a cast of thousands erupt across the screen and provide an indication that we are about to see a film that pays incredible attention to detail throughout its entirety. In every way, Scott has created a world for us that scuttles films of similar epic undertakings (and budgets!) and sends them to their dooms at the bottom of the murky depths of film history where they belong.\n\nThe cast is generally very strong. Crowe proves himself very suitable to the task with a great emotional range and depth of character. His accent ocassionally bugged me (as did the mish mash of accents on offer - but that is I guess a legacy of &apos;internationally casted films&apos;), but this aside, he was well and truly up to the task. Phoenix is also excellent as the disturbed Commodus, as is Nielson as Lucilla, the daughter of Marcus who &quot;should have been a son&quot; and finds herself torn between loyalty to her brother and doing what is &apos;right&apos;. The old guard thesps of Harris, Reed and Jacobi (Grachus) are uniformly strong as supporting characters, and Spencer Treat Clark (Lucius) does a fine job as the young heir to the throne.\n\nAdd to this great cast excellent editing and post production work, and an intricate soundscape (including a magnificent Hans Zimmer score), and you have a film that, despite its length, was highly palatable and had me in there from beginning to end. A must see."

      "reviewBody": "I always thought this was one of Charlie Chaplin&apos;s nicest, most under-appreciated silent movie gems. Then I discovered it really wasn&apos;t underrated; it&apos;s rated very high on most critics&apos; lists. It may be that I usually hear about some of his other movies than I do this one.\n\nPart of the reason I think so highly of this is simply that I&apos;m a sentimentalist and story in this film is a very touching one. It&apos;s a romance between Charlie&apos;s tramp character (no name) and a blind girl, who also had no name in this film. Virginia Cherill, who played the blind woman and had a wholesome, pretty face which I found very attractive.\n\nI&apos;m not always a huge fan of pantomime except for some great comedians of the era like Chaplin, Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton, but Chaplin was so good at it and this is one of the last of dying breed as &quot;talkies&quot; were out in full force by 1931. Chaplin was at his best in silent movies, anyway, and his comedy routines are legendary. He gave me a lot of laughs in this film, as always, and I particularly laughed (I love slapstick) at the boxing scene. Kudos, too, to Harry Myers as the &quot;eccentric millionaire.&quot;\n\nThere&apos;s a lot of drama as well as humor in this 86-minute gem as the Tramp tries to aid a blind girl, raising money so she can get an operation to restore her sight.\n\nComedy, romance, drama (with suffering) all combine to make this an extraordinary piece of entertainment. It&apos;s hard to believe this movie was not up for one, single Academy Award.",

What makes this movie so incredible is that while it is indeed a movie about magicians (or illusionists) it is also a complex character study about how self destructive obsessions are with a sideline love story and a sci-fi twist - very unique.",

      "reviewBody": "There are literally hundreds of comments about this movie on IMDB.  Many of them exhort its greatness.  I don&apos;t disagree with them.\n\nBut I&apos;d like to add a suggestion to those of you out there who haven&apos;t seen this film.  I&apos;d like to tell you HOW to watch it.\n\nThe people who made this movie didn&apos;t think they were producing a masterpiece. Bergman left the shoot disgusted.  The screenwriters were on salary for Warners, writing half a dozen movies a year, and this was just one more.  Bogie was punching the clock in the middle of a workhorse career.\n\nSo as an audience member, you can&apos;t sit down expecting gilded greatness.\n\nDon&apos;t have a Casablaca party.  Don&apos;t watch it on your first date, hoping it will lend that &quot;Romantic Touch.&quot;  Don&apos;t watch it as part of your &quot;I need to watch the Best 10 movies of all time&quot; Film School project.\n\nBuy this movie on DVD.  Have it at the ready.  And then, one Friday night, when your plans fall through and you find it&apos;s 10:30pm and there&apos;s nothing on TV that&apos;s any good, open a six pack of beer, or pour yourself some wine, and watch this movie in a darkened room.\n\nThe characters in Casablanca are absolutely devoid of sentimentalism.  Every one of them sees the world without a hint of rose color in their lenses.  As Rick says, &quot;Three little people don&apos;t amount to a hill of beans in this big old world.&quot;  If you&apos;re in a mood where you understand what he&apos;s saying, watch this movie and it will transport you.\n\nThere is no single movie that deserves to be called the best movie of all time.  Because movies, when all is said and done, don&apos;t amount to a hill of beans.  They are meant to entertain us, not for us to worship THEM.\n\nBut no movie has ever known this fact like Casablanca.\n\n If you watch Casablance this way, with no expectations, with no &quot;hype,&quot; you might catch 10 percent of its greatness on one viewing.  And that will be enough to start you on your way.\n\nHappy viewing, kid.",

      "name": "No western has ever come close to this one....and no western ever will.",
      "reviewBody": "I can&apos;t quite find the words to even come close to describing the pure brilliance of this movie. When this movie was made, the western genre was dominated by the big hollywood studios. The western was taken by these studios and transformed into an opportunity to portray classic superheroes like John Wayne and Burt Lancaster in their fight against all sorts of smalltime crooks and outlaws in smalltime stories and smalltime towns. It was a genuine effort to portray &apos;Americanism&apos;, the American Way, along with a romanticised view of the west as &apos;Frontier country&apos; where good always triumphed over bad and where the life was hard but honest. It was the American Way.\n\nAnd then came this film. The title, &apos;Once Upon A Time In The West&apos; must have seemed to mean nothing more than &apos;just another western&apos; to the unexpecting viewers at the time. Oh boy were they wrong. With this movie, Sergio Leone singlehandedly redefined the western genre and no American western would ever match the brilliant spirit in which it was made. While the story is basically the same as in any other western, it is the WAY in which it is presented that so clearly distances this western from others. Whereas other westerns are simply stories that are designed to entertain, this movie is an emotional masterpiece that will move your heart. Sergio Leone takes the ordinary western and replaces words with looks, and conversations with feelings and emotions. With his brutal but honest portrayal of the sheer hardness of life and death in those times he thoroughly destroys the old romantic idea of the west as a &apos;generally-hunky-dory-kind-of-scene with the occasional bad guy and indian&apos; and replaces it with an eerie, dark, hot and dry place where life is cheap and only the strongest will survive.\n\nI cannot adequately convey in words the way in which Sergio Leone deepens and defines the characters by pure means of visual persuasion. It starts with the three gunman in the beginning of the movie, waiting for some reason at a train station for someone or something that obviously is going to be on the next train. No explanation, no conversation; not a word is said. Even the stationmaster is ushered into captivity without a single audible threat. Then comes the waiting... Any other director would have skipped directly to the moment of arrival, but Sergio Leone takes minutes of boredom and translates it into a visual feast, deepening the characters that are portrayed and making them more human, more real to the viewer, while at the same time encompassing us with a deep dark sense of foreboding. This way in which the story is not just augmented but in times completely replaced by the sheer visual drama, is perfected by the absolute fantastic music, directed by Ennio Morricone. Who needs words and explanations when the combined forces of cinematic mastery and heart-tearing music are not just able to carry the story, but pick it up and push it up to such heights of excellence that it has no equal in it&apos;s genre?\n\nAnother great feat that adds to the power of this movie is the minimalistic way of portrayal of the characters as real, emotional people. Not a single word is said that isn&apos;t required for the understanding of the story, yet the characters feel more true than those in movies where whole conversations are added merely to explain their motives. Instead of words, the camera focuses on the characters...so that you can simply read the emotion off their faces. Often no explanation is given other than than a mere facial expression. No superheroes or supercriminals, just real, desire-laden, traumatised, obsessed people that act upon motives inherently understood by the viewer.\n\nAll in all this is without a single doubt in my mind the greatest western of all times, and even though Sergio Leone has made many more mindblowing, heart-shattering westerns like this one, like &apos;A Fistful of Dynamite&apos;, &apos;The Good The Bad and The Ugly&apos;, and &apos;For a Few Dollars More&apos;, none could equal &apos;Once Upon A Time In The West&apos; in sheer magnitude of perfection. Western has never been the same since....\n\nI only wish I&apos;d have been there in 1969 when the movie was new and see it, for the first time with fresh innocent eyes and an unexpecting mind..just like 2001: A Space Odyssey (also of 1969, a year of legends).\n\nA tip for those who have never seen this movie: Bribe, beg, borrow, or steal yourself into possession of a Videobeam and Hifi-audio equipment if you can&apos;t find a cinema that is showing this movie. Turn the audio up WAY HIGH (never mind the neighbors) and prepare never to be the same again.........\n\nI (obviously) gave this movie a 10 because no matter how hard I try I can&apos;t find anything less than perfect about it.",

      "reviewBody": "Movies can wield a strange power over those who sit in the darkened seats of a theatre.  The truly great ones manipulate your perception of reality, suspend your disbelief, and ultimately either alter or affirm your view on life.  NUOVO CINEMA PARADISO is just such a movie.  It is the near-perfect melding of direction, acting, script, sound track, and cinematography. Phillipe Noiret and Salvatore Cascio give the kind of performances usually associated with much more recognizable actors.  The supporting cast looks like they could all be full-blooded Sicilians.  The location shots add depth and realism to the entire production.  Ennio Morricone&apos;s music is simply the most appropriate and emotive I have ever had the pleasure to hear in a theatre.  Tornatore&apos;s script and direction are a joy, a breath of fresh air.\n\nI will not spoil this story by repeating it, nor will I give away the ending, although it matters not a whit.  I could disclose fully everything in this movie, and in seeing it, all my words would evaporate.  There is nothing like the experience of sitting through it, becoming engulfed by it, and in the end, being changed.",

In 1979, the technology didn&apos;t exist to generate a computer image of a Being from another world, and thank God, because this film would have sucked just like all these post-Alien creature features do.  Everyone who loves this movie knows what I&apos;m talking about.  Ridley Scott had to be extremely careful not to show a full shot of the Alien, except in very brief scenes, and not to reveal exactly how it moves, because then we would see that it is just some tall, skinny guy in a rubber suit.  Nowadays, some computer guy would whip up a really scary-looking, but nevertheless FAKE-looking (yes, computer guys, we can tell) Alien, and the director would not have to even think about trying to breathe life into H.R. Giger&apos;s hallucinations to make a successful picture.\n\nThe dark, cold beauty of this film will never be equaled."

      "reviewBody": "So just how insane is &apos;Apocalypse Now&apos;?  Well, let&apos;s say that it is the kind of film that makes you want to bang your head against the wall.  The beginning has no credits or titles; nothing.  The whole film seems like it&apos;s taking place on a different world, and as the story moves on, sanity itself is shed.  There was a French plantation scene that got cut out, and an alternate ending that would have had a massive battle scene outside Kurtz&apos;s compound.\n\n&apos;Apocalypse Now&apos; is not a realistic film in the sense that the presentation of the Vietnam War is far from correct: helicopters going in BEFORE the napalm strikes, a USO show in the jungle at night, and the final bridge all lit-up like a Christmas tree.  (for more realistic &apos;Nam War movies, try &apos;The Deer Hunter&apos; or &apos;Platoon&apos;)\n\nBut what &apos;Apocalypse Now&apos; lacks in historical accuracy, it makes up in artistic and dramatic scripting.  Some of the best photography and lighting ever can be found here.\n\nThe film also raises some severe philosophical issues, and gives us entirely new ones.  When the movie begins, the war is raging around us.  It is chaotic and nerve-racking, yet still rational.  When we finally get to Kurtz&apos;s base, the action has died down, but rational thinking has long since been vanquished to the point of total lunacy.  This shows us the truth about men of war in times of war and peace.  The voyage down the river has a sense of time travel (a sense that would have been much more apparent had the French Plantation scene remained.)  And when you get to the end, keep in mind the old phrase: The King is dead...  Long live the king.\n\nIs Kurtz insane?  Or are we not yet ready to understand him?  These questions and more are up to you as &apos;Apocalypse Now has no easy answers."

I couldn&apos;t be further from the truth.  This movie does things to your head that are illegal in some countries.  Portrayed (for all intents and purposes) backwards, it forces you to think in the same way that our lead character, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce being more brilliant than usual) does.  Suffering from a condition that renders him unable to remember anything for more than a few minutes, he is searching for the man who raped and killed his wife.  Since each seen lasts no more than 15 minutes before jumping back to the what happened before that, our perceptions are shattered in the same way.\n\nCarrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano (both of The Matrix) put in great performances that leave you guessing; simultaneously endearing and revolting.\n\nOverall I left the film trying to figure out what was what, and I&apos;m still not sure.  This film noir concept shouldn&apos;t work, but it does so wonderfully.",

You have the love of humanity in you.\n\nDon&apos;t hate. Only the unloved and the unnatural hate.\n\nSoldiers, don&apos;t fight for slavery, fight for liberty! St Luke says, &quot;The Kingdom of God is within man.&quot; Not in one man nor a group of men, but in all men. In you! You have the power to create machines, the power to create happiness.\n\nYou have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure.\n\nIn the name of democracy, let us use that power.\n\nLet us all unite, let us fight for a new world, a world that will give men a chance to work, that will give youth a future and old age security.\n\nPromising these things, brutes have risen.\n\nBut they lie! They do not fulfill that promise. They never will! Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people.\n\nNow let us fight to fulfill that promise! Let us fight to free the world, to do away with national barriers, to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance.\n\nLet us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to the happiness of all.\n\nSoldiers, in the name of democracy, let us unite!&quot;",

      "reviewBody": "I just saw this film and I confess that I am completely satisfied. I am not an admirer of Tarantino but I have little to say about this film, inspired by a character from the sixties western-spaghetti films and mixing western with blacksploitation. Tarantino&apos;s style (exaggerated, showy, extravagant and excessive) is all there before us, but unlike other films I didn&apos;t feel that this was a problem or transformed the film into a kind of parody.\n\nThe plot is about the search that Django, a former slave who is unexpectedly released and becomes a bounty hunter, will do for his wife, a slave who was sold and disappeared. He has the help of a German, responsible for his release. Together they discover that she is at the home of a rude slave-owner called Cotton Candy who, among other businesses, profits from death fights between slaves. So they decide to disguise themselves as experts in the field to go to his plantation and try to buy her freedom without Candy realizing what they want.\n\nThe film is very good and, despite being almost three hours long, it has no dead moments and entertains wonderfully. However, although Tarantino&apos;s exaggerations and histrionic vision were not a problem this time, there are some points that were really uncomfortable, mainly concerning historical rigor, which, we already know, is not something that he really takes seriously (another reason why I don&apos;t like him as a director). To begin with, such Mandingo Fights never existed. We are not in Ancient Rome and the slave owners, however bad they were, did not like to throw money out the window and kill for pleasure their best pieces! Tarantino went to get that silly idea from another film he liked and pasted it here. Another problem is the use of dynamite, which would only be invented a few years after the period in which the film takes place. The clothes also do not match the time or place of the action. The outfit of the Club&apos;s black maid, with that miniskirt, is particularly bad in that it sexualizes the character and imports a 21st century scent into the middle of the 19th century. I will not go on much longer, I think I proved my point. Another thing I have to say is that this is a very violent film, Tarantino style, that is, with a ton of blood for each bullet, spectacular shootings, some nudity and high doses of brutality. The dialogues are also full of racist insults and profanity, but I think that was something the film asked for, in support of its own credibility. In short, this is not a movie for anyone. With Tarantino, this is often taken for granted.\n\nThe main role was given to Jamie Foxx, and he is superb and gives the character a strength and toughness that I liked, and which contrast nicely with the polite sensitivity of Dr. Schultz, brilliantly played by Christopher Waltz. This actor had already done an extraordinary job in &quot;Inglorious Bastards&quot; and now he was even better, with a character that seems tailor-made for him. I was particularly impressed with the work of Leonardo Di Caprio, who rarely manages to make villains. He is an actor with a rare talent and has managed to be worthy of our contempt in this film. Another actor who shines in this film is the veteran Samuel L. Jackson, in the role of a black butler so fond of the owner that he becomes more slavish than whites. I also liked the brief cameo of honor of Franco Nero, the actor who played Django in the original films. It was an elegant and honorable way for Tarantino to bow to the actor and the work that inspired him. Much less impressive was the performance of Kerry Washington, who has little time and material to show what is worth.\n\nTechnically, it is a film full of notable aspects that require our attention and that, to a large extent, are part of the director&apos;s brand image. It is the case of cinematography and the use of strong colors and slow motion footage in action scenes, features of a strong visual style that Tarantino loves. The sets are good, and also the costumes despite the anachronisms that I have mentioned. The film has a pleasant pace, but the first half was generally better yet more restrained: it seems that Tarantino gets lost in his own style as he approaches the most violent scenes. The soundtrack is great and takes advantage of several songs by various composers. Personally, I enjoyed listening to the original song from &quot;Django&quot; by Luis Bacalov, and the songs composed for this film by Ennio Morricone, a name that will always be associated, in collective memory, with the great western-spaghetti of the past. It was a careful, effective and honorable selection in the way it honors the genre.",

In a society poisoned by secrecy, fear and the abuse of power, a number of the movie&apos;s characters -- artists, actors, writers -- must look deep inside and decide what they are made of; none more so than the investigator.\n\nThis is a movie that took me to a place and time that felt very authentic, for a tale that was very satisfying.\n\nUlrich Muhe, who plays the investigator, is mesmerizing, and the young director is to be applauded for this, his first full-length film. Some have compared &quot;The Lives of Others&quot; to Coppola&apos;s &quot;The Conversation&quot; but the two have completely different story arcs and are only superficially similar.\n\nBoth my companion and I felt this was our favorite of the six films we had a chance to see at the festival.",

Living alone in that giant house on Sunset, save for her servant Max, Norma whiles away the hours planning her magnificent return. Her fame kept alive by fan letters, and her hope of return kindled by Joe Gillis.  For Norma, there is no other life than standing before cameras and acting out lives of characters that are larger than life.  Of course, no one knows who Norma Desmond is.  Gloria Swanson gives a magnificent performance. She runs from melancholy, to unbridled joy, to complete mental breakdown. William Holden is the ultimate cynic.  He plays Norma like a fiddle but gets ensnared in her web of decaying glory.  In the end, Joe pays the price for enduring Norma&apos;s insanity.  As she descends that staircase in the final scene, you can see that she is completely lost in her own world.  A world where no one grows old, where she is forever young, and where she is the greatest star of them all.  After all, stars never age."

      "reviewBody": "From PASTO, COLOMBIA-Via: L. A. CA; CALI, COLOMBIA+ORLANDO, FL The ONLY Tony Kiss Castillo on FaceBook! ....................................\n\nShame on me for ignoring my own rule of thumb and slurping up so many of the gushing reviews for Wall-E. My expectation was somewhere around Pluto, but this only managed to take me to Saturn. Normally, Saturn would warrant a rave review, but not when a film falls somewhat short of that ever-so-high bar you&apos;ve set for it! Don&apos;t get me wrong. Pixar has hit a home run with Wall-E. They just did not hit one out of the park, as so many others would have you believe.\n\nThe movie really does work on just about every imaginable level. The Pixar animation team most certainly outdid themselves, taking CGI to an impressive and breathtakingly realistic new level for 2008. Wall-E is, at times thought-provoking, ironic, laugh-out-loud funny, poignant, entertaining, and perhaps, somewhat romantic. Yes, all of this with a highly original story line and offbeat musical accompaniment. Those elements which are borrowed from other movies are at least incorporated with a fresh twist.\n\nWall-E most definitely has its shortcomings: A little over the top at times in the &quot;Gee, aren&apos;t we just the cutest on screen Bots you&apos;ve ever seen?&quot; Department. There are also a couple occasions where the substitution of dialog for assorted sound effects becomes a bit tedious.\n\nFortunately, the movie is very low key as regards the results of long term ravaging of the environment, not at all in-your-face as so often is the case with movies made in the recent years. Taken as a whole, though, Wall-E deserves between 8 and 8 1/2*. In any case, please, simply put aside the reviews and just watch Wall-E, hopefully, leaving your expectations behind. You&apos;ll probably have a very enjoyable and entertaining 90 minutes.\n\n8* STARS*...ENJOY/DISFRUTELA!\n\nAny comments, questions or observations, in English or Espa\u00f1ol, are most welcome!",

I think the movie is so great because it contains almost everything you could ask (action, humor, heartfelt moments, great CGI, fantastic score, ...) in a balanced way. Furthermore even if the culmination of the MCU happened in &quot;Endgame&quot; it was here that every piece of the Marvel Universe was brought together for the first time. I remember to have an astronomical hype at the time and the fact that the movie resulted to be even better than what my hype was making envisioning me is something that I highly count. But the best part of this movie is its villain, Thanos. I loved him (and still do) and he absolutely stole the show and sets up Endgame perfectly. Clearly &quot;Infinity War&quot; has its flaws and I am not here to say it is perfect like a 10/10 rating would usually mean, but for what it represented at the time and the way it was delivered I think we couldn&apos;t have asked for more.",

Suspend your disbelief for a couple of hours and enjoy this banquet of a romp. Charles Laughton showed here what he was made of better, more clearly and more loudly than in any other film and all of his films, at least the moments with him in it, are unforgettable - Captain Blight or Henry VIII, Quasimodo or that malefic Senator from South Carolina. Here the severity of his lawyer by vocation takes your senses away with his masterful judicial way to see logic and it&apos;s such an incredible fun to watch him do it. Tyrone Power is a toy in his hands but not Marlene Dietrich who stands her ground, not merely as a character but as a presence on the screen. Billy Wilder visits early Hitchcock territory with wit and fun. Elsa Lanchester&apos;s nurse is the cherry on top of this delightful film.",

      "reviewBody": "I was never a big fan of horror movies. They usually try cheap tricks to scare their audiences like loud noises and creepy children. They usually lack originality and contain overacting galore. The only horror movie i like was Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon. It was well-acted, and had a great story. But it has been joined and maybe even surpassed by Stanley Kubrick&apos;s The Shining, quite possibly the scariest movie ever.\n\nThe movie follows a writer (Jack Nicholson) and his family who agree to watch over a hotel while it is closed for the winter. There were rumors of the place being haunted and the last resident went crazy and murdered his family. But Jack is convinced it will be OK and he can use the quiet to overcome his writer&apos;s block. After months of solitude and silence however, Jack becomes a grumpy and later violent. Is it cabin fever or is there something in the hotel that is driving him mad?\n\nOne of the creepiest parts about the movie is the feeling of isolation that Kubrick makes. The hotel is very silent, and the rooms are huge, yet always empty. It is also eerily calm when Jack&apos;s son is riding his bike through the barren hallways. Jack Nicholson&apos;s performance is also one of his very best, scaring the hell out of me and making me sure to get out once in awhile. My favorite scene is when he is talking to a ghost from inside a walk-in refrigerator.\n\nThe Shining is tops for horror movies in my opinion, beating the snot out of crap like the Ring and The Blair Witch Project. It may be a oldie, but is definitely a goodie. 8/10",

      "reviewBody": "This seems to be Miyazake&apos;s most personal work, clearly a serious design. It is set in an imaginary time which blends the time of the ancient gods (Shinto style, gods of place and nature) with the settlement of humans and the coming of metalworking and war.  The world is not in balance, and a distant conflict between industry and nature has wounded one of the gods of the forest, which is then killed by a sentry boy as it rampages into farmland he guards.  The evil controlling it transfers to him, beginning a slow takeover, and he must journey to the origin of the conflict to find a way to cure himself and incidentally, as he will learn, to try to restore balance.  But this is not a simplistic tale, he finds there are other characters in play, and there is good and evil in everyone, and no easy balance.  The Princess (Hime) of the story is a mysterious human who has been raised by wolves (which are themselves powerful forest gods, a little reminiscent of the Amerindian Coyote myth), who becomes both his ally and his enemy.  The story is not easy to understand.  It has many Japanese mythic elements but even then, it is a work of Miyazake&apos;s unique imagination, and is not intended to be simple or to have a clean resolution.\n\nThe animation is spectacular, and unusual, with new elements even for Miyazake and marks a new departure for style which you can see continued in his next film, Sen to Chihiro - more nature, more wild, more jamming on elements from Japanese myth and folklore.  And, continuing the trend to be more personal, concerned with ethics and character, and less sci-fi. There are at least half a dozen well developed characters threaded through the story, and their animation is wonderful in displaying subtle character.\n\nThe original Japanese soundtrack has some amazing singing and draws upon some of the best talent available for voices - in Japan, Miyazake is universally known and this was a masterpiece carefully crafted.  Japanese television documented a lot of the production.  The English translation drew on some good talent but they seem not to have &quot;gotten it&quot; quite so intensely as the Japanese crew.\n\nIf you haven&apos;t seen Miyazake, give it a try (but maybe look at Sen to Chihiro first, or even Laputa or Kiki&apos;s Delivery Service, for easier and lighter introduction to his work).  Some say he is the Japanese Disney, but I don&apos;t like that.  His work has a depth and sophistication that goes beyond Disney cute.  There is no other animation like it.  This is truly an adult work: children might like some of the visuals, but I doubt that many kids below teen age will have any idea what it is all about, and even adults will get more out of this each time you see it again.",

Everything the film promised and more was delivered. This is a truly wonderful film. It is beautifully acted, brutally and painstakingly directed and as good a display of raw emotion as I have witnessed in any language. The story is gripping, the characters believable and well rounded, the emotion human and the feeling I was left with at the end of the film is one of awe. And that was after I had watched it twice. Honestly, this is a truly, truly wonderful film. Do not miss it under any circumstances!",

So as a person that really puts his soul to a movie he watches I have to say that this film is one of the most beautiful things I&apos;ve ever had the pleasure of witnessing.\n\nCoco does a fantastic job of capturing the viewer from the first moment. It cleverly captures the beauty of the &quot;Day of the Dead&quot; tradition, by unfolding one of the most heartwarming stories I&apos;ve ever seen in a movie, around it. The film features a young Musician called Miguel and the pursuit of his dream of being a musician against his family&apos;s approval. Throughout the movie while Miguel engages in an adventurous journey through the land of the dead, he is caught between the love he has for music and the importance of family bonds.  Quiet a simple and pretty well covered subject. Somehow, Coco manages to so simply and beatifully capture the essence of what it means to be human. What it means to love and what it means to have passion for the things and the people you love. The story was told in such an elegant way that it didn&apos;t make me think about the values it represented, but instead it made me feel them, without me even analysing what I was watching. It did it so gradually that at some point near the end I was so overwhelmed by a scene, which definetely goes to my &quot;top 10 best movie scenes&quot; list, that I caught myself crying. Not tearing up like I usually do when a scene touches me. Actually crying.\n\nI could go on and on about Coco, but I&apos;ll leave with saying that this is a fantastic movie and I honestly feel grateful that I had the chance to watch it.\n\nA must see!!!",

The movie is incredibly well made, its huge production is quite breathtaking to view. This is a true cinematic experience, to behold. The movie exceeded my expectations in terms of action, and entertainment. The movie&apos;s score high-lites many of its incredible scenes, and at times, it takes your breath away.\n\nThe film featured excellent performances, by all the cast. Christian Bale, as always is great as Batman. Anne Hathaway was completely engrossing, she became &quot;Catwoman&quot;, just like Michele Pfeiffer did, although their interpretations were very different, both were equally effective. Tom Hardy was the main villain &quot;Bane&quot; completely shattered my expectations. One of the best superhero movie villains, I&apos;ve ever seen. The terror caused by him, is completely believable and quite menacing. Marlion Cotilliard, Michael Cane, Gary Oldman, and others all did well in their respective roles. Now I know most will miss Heath Ledger as the Joker.(I know I do) I hope people don&apos;t compare Tom Hardy&apos;s performance to Heath Ledger&apos;s, its completely unfair and the two characters are very different. Just read the comics.\n\nThe colossal size of the film is a spectacle to behold, but surprisingly you don&apos;t get lost with all the explosions and extravagant action scenes, like in other films,(AKA Transformers, or POTC.) If one were to gripe, and I suppose there will never be a film made that one cannot find a point at which to grip, it is painfully long running time here. I found myself more worried about the pain in my posterior than the emotional final minutes after almost 3 hours that I had spent in a cramped seat, but that&apos;s just how I am. However the ending is just fantastic, so emotional and bring the trilogy to a very satisfying end.\n\nSorry if I&apos;m being all fan-boyish and kissing this movie&apos;s behind, but I really admire it. It may not be among my personal favorites but generally this seems to be the movie event of this year. As a film though, this is amazing. A true lasting legacy in superhero story telling and summer-blockbusters.",

      "name": "Excellent sequel--matches the brilliance of the first film",
      "reviewBody": "Series note: It is strongly advised that you watch this film only after seeing Alien (1979). This is a direct continuation of that story.\n\n57 years after the events of the first film, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is found and awakened from hyper sleep to discover that a terraforming colony has been set up on LV-426, the planet wherein she and her fellow crew of the mining cargo spaceship Nostromo first encountered the titular aliens. When Earth-based communications loses contact with LV-426, a band of marines are sent to investigate, taking Ripley and a representative from the company that financed the colony, Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) along for the ride.\n\nFor the difficult job of following up Ridley Scott&apos;s excellent Alien, director James Cameron decided to go a completely different route--to make a fast moving, slightly tongue-in-cheek, boisterous action extravaganza. Remarkably, he was able to do that while still maintaining a stylistic and literary continuity that melds Aliens seamlessly with the first film.\n\nRipley is much more fully developed in this film, although unfortunately, some of the most significant scenes were deleted from the theatrical release (if at all possible, watch the 2-hour and 37-minute director&apos;s cut instead). Cameron fashioned Aliens into a grand arc where Ripley&apos;s actions at the end of the film have much more meaning as she&apos;s not only fighting monsters, but also fighting to retain a semblance of something she lost due to her 57-year hyper sleep. As in the first film, she is still the most intelligent, courageous and resourceful member of the crew, but she has much more colorful company.\n\nThe marines accompanying Ripley back to LV-426 may be too cartoonish for some tastes (as for viewers of that opinion, most of the action and the film overall is likely to be too cartoonish), but for anyone more agreeable to that kind of caricatured exaggeration, it&apos;s a joy to watch. I&apos;m a big fan of both Bill Paxton and Lance Henriksen, and both turn in wonderfully over-the-top performances, at their diametrically opposed ends of the emotional spectrum--Paxton as the spastic surfer/redneck and Henriksen as the intense, moody sage, with a surprising reality and an even more surprising conscience to go along with it. We also get a cigar-chomping Sergeant, a crazy, butch Private, and a complex, pensive Corporal as main characters, and a mysterious, bright young girl (played in a terrific performance by Carrie Henn). Much of the center section of the film hinges on the interrelationships of these characters, despite the action trappings going on around them.\n\nCameron carries over the crypt/labyrinth motif of the first film, and adds a metaphorical descent into the bowels of hell in the climax. The action throughout is suspenseful. Aliens contains one of my favorite &quot;cat fights&quot; in any film. It&apos;s also worth noting the influence this film may have had on Paul Verhoeven&apos;s Starship Troopers (1997)--although admittedly, we could say that Cameron was influenced a bit by the Robert A. Heinlein book, as well. Throughout all of the varied action sequences, as well as the important early scenes of colonists on LV-426, Cameron is able to clearly convey the logistics of very complex sets, so that viewers remain on the edges of their seats.\n\nPart of what makes the monsters so effective is that we&apos;re not told too much about them. We only get glimpses into their physiology&apos;s, their behavioral patterns and their intelligence. Cameron gives us just enough to become wrapped up in the film, but not so much that we become overly familiar with the aliens, or start to question the logic behind the film. He also smartly carries over some devices from the first film that were abandoned to an extent, such as the acidic blood of the aliens, and he supplies answers to the few questions that the first film raised, such as why the blood doesn&apos;t corrode instruments and objects when a dead alien is examined.\n\nAliens is yet another example of a sequel that is just as good as an original film in a series. Just make sure you watch both in order, and try to watch the director&apos;s cuts.",

      "reviewBody": "Many people compare &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot; with &quot;The Godfather&quot;. In my opinion these two movies can&apos;t be compared. Both are masterpieces in their own way, but each of them has a different style. You don&apos;t compare a Picasso to Michelangelo&apos;s Sixteen Chapel either, do you?\n\nWhat is it that makes this movie a masterpiece? Well, first of all there is the director. Sergio Leone is a real master when it comes to creating a special atmosphere, full of mystery, surprises and drama... He&apos;s one of the few directors who understands the art of cutting a movie in such a way that you stay focused until the end. \n\nThe way the movie was cut is also the reason why a lot of Americans don&apos;t think this movie is very special. There are three versions, but only the European version is how the director imagined it to be. He didn&apos;t want his movie to be shown in chronological order (1910&apos;s - 1930&apos;s - 1960&apos;s), but wanted to mix these three periods of time. The studio cut the movie in chronological order, loosing a lot of its originality and therefor getting a lot of bad critics. If you want to see this film the way Sergio Leone saw it, you have to make sure you get the director&apos;s cut. \n\nThe second reason why this movie is so great is the music. Ennio Morricone, who is seen as the greatest writer of film music ever, did an excellent job. Together with the images, the music speaks for itself in this movie. From time to time there isn&apos;t said a word, but the music and the images on their own tell the story. He understood perfectly what Sergio Leone wanted and composed most of the music even before the movie was shot.\n\nLast but not least there is also the acting and the script. The actors all did an excellent job. But what else can you expect from actors like Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci... They helped making this movie as great as it is by putting there best effort in it. The script helped them with it. It took twelve years to complete, but it hasn&apos;t left any detail untouched. The writers really thought of everything when creating it.\n\nI can really recommend this movie to everyone, but especially to people who like the gangster genre. When you want to see the movie, you better be sure that you will have the time for it. This isn&apos;t a movie that is finished after 90 minutes. You&apos;ll have to be able to stay focused during 3 hours and 47 minutes, which will certainly not be easy during the first 20 to 30 minutes. Some scenes at the beginning only make sense when you have seen the end of the movie. But when you are able to stay focused, you&apos;ll find this one of the best movies you&apos;ve ever seen. I certainly did and I rewarded it with a well deserved 10/10.",

Everyone needs to realize that I have a fascination with submarine films. I loved The Hunt for Red October and Crimson Tide. Both of them rank as my top action films. I don&apos;t know why I love this genre so much. I think it has to do somewhat with my passion for sci-fi. The ocean is almost like fighting in another world. So many times we have seen wars play out on land, and while there is only so much you can show with a land fight, the war field on the open sea allows for so much more creativity. \n\nDirector Wolfgang Peterson gives us some great characters. While not much dialogue happens in this film, you can see everyone&apos;s expressions on their faces, and those expressions tell better stories than words. You can see their fear, their excitement, their sadness, and their power by just the way that Peterson directs them. With his direction, I felt that I was on this U-Boat with the crew. Peterson perfectly portrays a feeling of crampness and claustrophobia wrapped together as one. I think that during one of the bombing scenes I broke a sweat because of what was happening on screen. \n\nFinally, I am also a fan of films that tell a different angle on the story. So many years I have watched war movie after war movie that show the victorious American&apos;s beating the classic &quot;evil-doers&quot;. Now don&apos;t get me wrong, these are fun sometimes, but I love to see a different angle. In history class we didn&apos;t learn about the casualties of the Germans in WWII. We learn about them as a statistic, and never put these heroes on a human level. This film humanizes the German&apos;s conditions during the war. The Germans are human being also, who fought for their country just as valiantly as our soldiers did during WWII. They had families, they had pasts, they had homes that they left to become a part of history. To fight for your beliefs. That is what America teaches us, fight for what we believe in....doesn&apos;t it? \n\nI could talk about this for hours, but instead I am going to sit back, relax, and tell you how wonderful Das Boot was to watch. I have not been this entertained for a long time. Bravo to everyone involved in this film. I think it IS the best war film ever released (that I have seen). I want everyone to get out of their seats this weekend and go rent this movie. I guarantee that you will not be disappointed. \n\nGrade: ***** out of *****"

      "reviewBody": "Toshiro Mifune is a businessman in a Japan that is on the brink of the Economic Miracle of the Sixties.  He is an honest man who loves his job as a shoe factory exec and is in a battle for corporate control against a pack of hyenas.  He has mortgaged and borrowed and scraped to raise the money for a surprise coup when his son is kidnapped.  But there is a major plot twist: it is not HIS son that was taken but his son&apos;s playmate, the chauffeur&apos;s kid and the ransom demanded is astronomical.  If he pays he will lose everything he has worked so hard for, but can he just sacrifice the chauffeur&apos;s child because it is not his?  From here on High and Low (perhaps better translated as Heaven and Hell) is a police procedural based on an Ed McBain 87th precinct story.\n\nWatching this film I had a rare, almost unique, experience.  I saw it on a fairly screen tv, letterboxed, in a darkened room.  All the preceding conditions helped contribute to put me into an objective/subjective middle ground where I had the feeling of looking through a special visor that allowed me to see the world by means of an almost perfect film as if through the eyes of a cinematic genius who is in total command of his artistic means and in total command of his subject matter.  I think the key to this experience is that while High and Low is interesting as human drama, it is yet peculiarly uninvolving emotionally but very involving cinematically. These distances are important in Kurosawa&apos;s films (he is high on my list of top ten directors but after Welles).  In IKIRU you probably could not be more deeply involved emotionally, while in RAN there is nothing but relentless distance.\n\nI think a good companion film to watch with this would be Kurosawa&apos;s earlier, looser, but much more individually tense, police film STRAY DOG (this time Mifune is the cop)",

      "reviewBody": "In 1984, Saul Zaentz, Peter Shaffer and Milos Forman collaborated in bringing a truly remarkable life to the silver screen. The story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, through the eyes of rival composer, Antonio Salieri. The film is complete with an insightful script (courtesy of Mr. Shaffer), magnificent acting, wondrous sets and costume designs, incredible choreography (thanks to Twyla Tharp), and, above all, the glorious music of Mozart himself.\n\nThe movie of Salieri&apos;s life, through which Mozart played an integral part, is told in flashback mode, beginning in around the year 1822. An old and perhaps emotionally disturbed Antonio Salieri attempts suicide, and in doing so, apologizes for killing Mozart some 31 years earlier. He survives and is admitted to an insane asylum, where he tells a young priest his tale of jealousy and mediocrity.\n\nThe priest is fascinated and alternately troubled by the lengthy and emotional story. Salieri tells of growing up in Italy with a father who did not care for music; and how he rejoiced for the chance to go to Vienna after his father&apos;s untimely death. He tells of how he first had met the young Mozart, and how immature and dirty minded Mozart was. He also tells of how &quot;The Creature&quot; had an intimate relationship with the girl that Salieri had cared for. Most importantly, however, he confided in the priest that he had learned to hate God for giving him a deep love of  music, only to deny him the talent to create truly memorable music. He thought God had given him Mozart to mock him. Salieri&apos;s heart filled with such rage, such hatred and such jealousy, that he had vowed to himself to make God an enemy and to kill the young Mozart.\n\nAs the movie moves along, carrying with it a deep sadness of the human condition, it also celebrates life by giving the audience joyous music, wonderful atmosphere and a general appreciation of humanity for not only eighteenth century Europe, but in any age where music speaks for our emotions.\n\nThe movie won eight Academy Awards in March of 1985. The only reason it did not win nine was that Tom Hulce was nominated for best actor instead of best supporting actor. He actually was in a supporting role, and in a strange twist of irony, F. Murray Abraham won the best actor statuette; citing probably the only time when Salieri beat out Mozart in anything.\n\nThe movie itself was shot in Prague where Milos Forman said &quot;(It) is a gem because it&apos;s possible to pivot the camera a full three hundred and sixty degrees and never encounter a modern vision.&quot; Very few new sets had to be built, as the scenes and buildings they found were quite often apropos to their needs.\n\nAmadeus works well on virtually every cinematic plane that exists. It is a masterpiece that must be viewed multiple times to receive what the film has to offer. The emotions of humanity, through the eyes of the troubled Salieri, indeed speak for all of mediocrity. He is their champion and their king.",

      "reviewBody": "This is by far one of the best, if not THE, movies of the 90&apos;s. &quot;American Beauty&quot; stole my vote immediately as I started watching it. The idea and concept of &quot;American Beauty&quot; is just some ordinary people on an ordinary block with ordinary lives.\n\nKevin Spacey plays Lester Burnam, a middle aged married man who has lost some hope in life. He has a job that is degrading, a wife who refuses to show any type of loving emotion towards him, a daughter who practically hates herself, and is judged constantly as a looser. But all of a sudden, he sees his daughter&apos;s friend, Angela, and something snaps in him to do something with his life. He quits his job and takes, the dreaded by most Americans, a fast food cook job. He starts working out and doing some illegal substances. Even though this sounds like he is ruining his life, it actually helps him and makes him realize how much he loves &quot;the precious moments in his stupid little life.&quot; You have no idea what he is talking about I&apos;m sure, but don&apos;t worry, you will some day. Kevin Spacey was by far the best actor in 1999 and deserved this Oscar 100%.\n\nAnnete Benning plays Carol Burnam, Lester&apos;s wife. She is a very fake and unsuccessful real estate agent who cannot get a sale. Her image in life is &quot;in order to be successful, one most project an image of success at all times&quot;. You can tell, she is not happy with her marriage and starts to have an affair with the big boss of the real estate company. Again, seems horrible, but it helps her in the end. Annete was unfortunately robbed of an Oscar for this film.\n\nThe supporting cast: Thora Birtch who plays Janie, Lester and Carol&apos;s daughter, is extremely depressed and hates her body and herself. But when she notices a strange boy next door and develops a relationship with him, she realizes how precious life is and starts communicating with her family. Mena Suvari plays Angela, Janie&apos;s best friend, Lester&apos;s crush, and a girl who is clearly insecure despite her attempts at showing her sexy side to every guy in town. Wes Bentley plays Ricky, the next door neighbor boy who looks at something as simple as a bag being tossed in the wind as something beautiful. Some say that this was a very stupid scene, but I disagree. His dialog was perfect and made us look twice at something so simple. He won most of our hearts despite having somewhat of an arrogant attitude. Wes without a doubt got robbed of a nomination for this movie. Chris Cooper plays Ricky&apos;s father, Col. Frank Fits. He is a military Sergent who is very abusive to his wife and son and is an obvious homophobic that turns into an ironic situation in the end. Chris also should&apos;ve been nominated.\n\nThe most stunning character actually to me was Allison Janney who played Barbara Fits, Ricky&apos;s mom, and Frank&apos;s wife. She was so beautiful and perfect. Her scene in the front room with Frank and Ricky, everything is so quite, and she says &quot;I&apos;m sorry, what?&quot;. Ricky says &quot;Mom, no one said anything&quot;. When Ricky gets kicked out by Frank after a horrible accusation, Ricky says &quot;Mom, I&apos;m leaving&quot;. Instead of being like the average mom and trying to stop him or say things will get better, she knows this is best and says &quot;OK. Wear a raincoat&quot;. Allison was just amazing and didn&apos;t get enough credit for her role.\n\nIf there could have been nominations for every role in this movie, they were well deserved. This is a terrific movie that should be watched by every adult. It&apos;ll make you look again at your life and think. What a great movie.\n\n10/10",

      "reviewBody": "Braveheart is the best movie ever made in history, an absolute sculpted work of art that depicts every emotion of human existence, from suffering, to courage to love, in front of the background of political astuteness and socio-hierarchal analysis.\n\nTelling the quasi-true story of one man&apos;s conviction and courage to exact vengeance for the killing of his first wife and father at the hands of the ruthless King Edward the II of England, who in turn inspires his small province of Scotland to rebel and go to war in a real fight for freedom and independence, Braveheart is a stunning depiction of the capacity of the human spirit to overcome the odds, defy tyranny, and achieve justice, respect, and dignity against oppression.\n\nAlthough its retractors and critics will dwell and harp on the historical accuracy of some of the movie, particularly what part Robert the Bruce played in real life, there is no denying the true power and emotional influence of this movie. It&apos;s understandable, particularly for Europeans, how this could be problematic due to their upbringing in studying history, but the movie is not really about being historically perfect; it&apos;s a work of art about things much deeper. A documentary it is not, and it&apos;s duplistic and hypocritical for the film&apos;s haters to dwell on this minor detail, but perhaps allow historical rewriting to slide and give it a free pass in something like Tarantino&apos;s Inglourious Basterds or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\n\nOn this topic, one of the dozens of best parts in the movie is when Robert the Bruce plays an important role in one of the battles, and eventually the movie does come around and get Robert&apos;s history back on track with more accuracy as to his part and character in the battle for Scotland&apos;s independence.\n\nWithout trying to get the history perfect, this movie is simply flawless. It&apos;s beyond flawless, really. A flawless movie can just be a technical masterpiece with very little power, but the raw power and emotion coming off the screen in practically every single scene in Braveheart is like an inferno.\n\nJames Horner&apos;s score is one of the greatest scores ever for any movie, and it successfully enhances the drama and emotion of each scene, without coming across as manipulative. It fits perfectly into every single scene it is used.\n\nThere isn&apos;t one acting role that is not well-done. This is one of Gibson&apos;s best acting roles, and the guy who plays Edward II gives an outstanding performance.\n\nThis is the greatest epic movie ever created in the history of Hollywood. A few years later, another great modern epic Gladiator came out and drew rightful comparisons to Braveheart, but while Gladiator is a very good movie, it lacks in the emotional depth, power, and ultimate inspiration behind the experience of watching Braveheart.\n\nThe final Act of Braveheart is one of the most powerful ever put on film. As a first time viewer, you really have no idea where the story is going to go (even as a repeat viewer it still holds weight). To this day, there is still nothing like it. Just when you think it&apos;s over or you know how it will end, it just continues to twist and turn, and then it closes with what is probably the best ending of any movie in history.\n\nIn addition to all of this, the body of Braveheart is loaded with outstanding battle scenes, incredible editing, and great dialogue rooted in inspiration, political strategy, philosophy, and stunning human experience of love, desire, passion, suffering, and identity.\n\nWhen you look at the top rated movies on IMDB, it is laughable that comic book movies and good popcorn-fun movies are actually rated above this. This is without a doubt, hands down, one of the top 25 movies ever made, and in my opinion, it is the #1 best movie of all-time.\n\nThis movie is a masterpiece.",

It is incredibly well done and it had a hold of me from beginning to end. Fair warning for any Tarantino movie, be prepared for the gore and violence. It runs rampant throughout the movie, but it&apos;s kind of gratifying seeing it happen to the Nazis.",

      "reviewBody": "Sure, this film&apos;s plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn&apos;t amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting&apos;s genius is profoundly unrealistic.\n\nYet I&apos;m giving this one 10 out of 10.\n\nI don&apos;t know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.\n\nNot only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.\n\nYou could read a lot of self-help books, but they won&apos;t bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it&apos;s like to be scared, what it&apos;s like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.\n\nThe first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.\n\nAs cinema, it&apos;s fair to middling. The performances are all first class. The script is a jewel. As wisdom, it&apos;s second to none. A fine achievement.",

While there had been other Sci-Fi movies with a theme of conflict in outer space, the &apos;Star Wars&apos; trilogy filled our imaginations like no other movies before them. The fantastic, strange worlds were presented almost like we were there too. Aliens sitting around a tavern, enjoying drinks and speaking in all sorts of languages. Nothing before had approached the sheer size of the space ships depicted here, huge cities traveling all over the galaxy. And how about the jump to hyper speed, then disappearing from the screen as the speed exceeds light speed! And the light sabres of the Jedi Knights. The Jedi Knights, a striking parallel to the Japanese Samurai.\n\nAfter the fantastic &apos;Star Wars&apos; and &apos;Empire Strikes Back&apos; (now called parts IV and V on DVD), the last episode &apos;Return of the Jedi&apos; was bound to be somewhat of a let down, but not much of one. It was made to achieve resolution. Of the rebels&apos; battle with the evil Empire. The relationship between Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, and the Princess, and her relationship with Han Solo. We witness Luke&apos;s Jedi training at the hands of Yoda, as Luke becomes the Last Samurai, I mean Jedi. The DVDs finally came out last month, and they are near perfect, as we should expect from Lucas Films and THX. The bit rate is high, and the picture is nothing short of superb. As is the Dolby EX surround track. \n\nMy wife and I watched all three of the movies on DVD this week -- Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi (now on DVD called parts IV, V, and VI) -- compliments of our local public library. It was an appropriate reminder how good these movies are, and still ahead of their time. Nothing else has been made to compare to them."

      "reviewBody": "Come and See is one of the rare films that I can remember being emotionally drained upon its conclusion. The expression on my face as I sat there watching the credits scroll by seemed as worn and broken as that of the protagonist, Florya.\n\nThe film follows Florya as he &quot;joins&quot; (i.e. obtains a gun) a partisan group resisting the German advancements in the forests of his native Byelorussia during World War II. What he witnesses at the ripe age of 12 changes a once open-eyed, smiling face into a weathered, traumatized one that has experienced the unimaginable.\n\nAnd of course the unimaginable were the Nazi atrocities committed during the war. Come and See does not focus on what the German Army did to the Jewish population but rather what they did to the native Soviet population. The Nazis were not only concerned with the utter destruction of the Jews but of the Bolshevik Party as well. And to Hitler that meant any man, woman, or child living under communist rule. And this &quot;cleansing&quot; fell into the hands of the SS who, as depicted in the movie, literally destroyed every sign of life.\n\nFlorya is able to escape death, unlike the rest of his family, but serves as a witness to the destruction and in this sense &quot;dies&quot; as his innocence and youth is lost. Klimov does a masterful job and depicting this slow death by concentrating on the facial expressions of Florya versus that of the Germans and both of their transformations over time. Klimov&apos;s Hitler montage at the end is especially moving and puts an interesting spin on the whole &quot;what if&quot; question.\n\nThis is the most historically accurate war movie I have ever seen and would highly recommend it to any war/history enthusiast. But I would also recommend it to any film watcher that realizes the goal of the medium which is to evoke emotion in the audience, and Come and See does just that.",

Not only because of the psychological horror (of which 2001 is a masterpiece) but also because of the way it brought me (a restless soul) some clarity to the way I observe the universe. It changed my way of thinking in a very profound way. And after reading the novel (by Arthur C. Clarke) I found myself once again inspired (a writer as I am) by the level of imagination.\n\nThe Space Odyssey is not something one can just &quot;go and see&quot;. One has to be ready for it, or it cannot be understood. In fact I don&apos;t think it can be understood at all, at least not all of it at once. It is a philosophical journey to the infinite and beyond, a masterpiece of it&apos;s genre and still after 32 years technically quite impressive all the way to the powerful musical soundtrack featuring &apos;Also spracht Zarathustra&apos; by Richard Strauss and &apos;Blue Danube&apos; by Johann Strauss.\n\nTake all the time you want, but eventually you are going to have to see this film. If it can bring some order and understanding to the universe of a struggling artist like me, it can certainly do it for you as well.\n\nOr maybe I&apos;m just plain crazy...",

      "reviewBody": "One of the many things that made Hitchcock such a great director is that he did not just stick to the same formula time after time; all of his best movies have their own unique feel and characteristics.  &quot;Vertigo&quot; is particularly distinctive, both as a complex story filled with suspense, and as a fascinating study in psychological tension.  While it lacks the humor of some of Hitchcock&apos;s other masterpieces, and sometimes moves rather slowly, it is unforgettable, and a great achievement by the director and his cast.\n\nIf you have never seen it, you will enjoy it more if you do not know too much about the plot, although the actual story is somewhat secondary to the ways that the characters are tested and their weaknesses exposed by the various events.  Hitchcock uses a complicated story, interesting characters, lavish visual detail, and deliberate pacing, plus a fine musical score by the incomparable Bernard Hermann, to produce a mysterious, almost unearthly, atmosphere.  The tension rarely lets up, and the viewer is caught up completely in it, at times almost to the point of discomfort.  It&apos;s the kind of film that repays careful attention, as almost every moment is filled with significant detail.\n\nThere are also some great acting performances.  Jimmy Stewart is outstanding in a role far different from his usual screen persona.  He enables the viewer to sympathize completely with him, even as we cringe at many of his character&apos;s actions and decisions.  Kim Novak is completely convincing in a difficult dual role, and the movie would not have been as compelling without her fine performance.  The rest of the cast all have much smaller roles, but are all quite good too, especially Barbara Bel Geddes as Scottie&apos;s (Stewart&apos;s) old friend, who provides important insight into Scottie&apos;s character.\n\n&quot;Vertigo&quot; is a classic by any standard.  It&apos;s a must-see that remains just as impressive with each viewing."

      "name": "Emotionally draining but truly moving &quot;ripped from the headlines&quot; story",
      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Hunt&quot; is the latest unflinching drama from Danish auteur Thomas Vinterberg. Co-written with Tobias Lindholm, this is an ambitious star vehicle for legendary actor Mads Mikkelsen, an icon in Denmark and familiar face around the world as well. He plays Lucas, a small-town kindergarten teacher. At its heart the story is ultimately a powerful comment on prejudice, based on true incidents, that may leave you emotionally drained but truly moved.\n\nTo delve into the plot here would reveal too much. So I&apos;ll just say that the film is quite dark and deals with some very difficult subject matter that can be very hard to watch at times. I&apos;ll leave it to you to decide if you want to be more aware of the details by looking up a basic synopsis.\n\nThis is essentially a one-man show. While supporting cast members are all up to the challenge, Lucas is on on screen virtually every moment of the movie and its overall success rises or falls on his believability. Mikkelsen&apos;s delicately underplayed characterization of a man under fire likely won&apos;t be appreciated or understood by all viewers. His restrained performance is remarkable and does much to make The Hunt a haunting, memorable experience. Among the children, Annika Wedderkopp&apos;s portrayal of Klara is frighteningly brilliant. She steals every scene she&apos;s in.\n\nThe physical beauty of the production belies the ugliness beneath. Natural lighting is used to match the heights and depths of the kindergarten children&apos;s emotions. Their innocence is reflected in its intensity. When surrounded by love, they are glowing. The color palette is warm and inviting. As fear rises, they appear in shadow. The tableau turns increasingly darker as the narrative does.\n\nThis is a very quiet and thoughtful experience in many ways. Nikolaj Egelund&apos;s score is sparse. Editors Janus Billeskov Jansen and Anne \u00d8sterud keep the pace measured and deliberate. The focus is on the story. Long takes without dialogue are quite effective as so much is said in the eyes, in the faces, of Lucas, the kids, and townsfolk. Cinematographer Charlotte Bruus Christensen allows the lush landscape of the Danish countryside to lull the viewer into a sense of peace, in contrast with the turmoil just under the surface, ready to jump out like a demon in a horror film. But these are real life nightmares, not the product of a genre writer&apos;s imagination, which chill to the bone.\n\nHollywood could never touch this subject and have anywhere near the impact. Backed independently by Swedish and Danish production companies, director Vinterberg actually intended to set and shoot the picture in Canada but better tax incentives and financing led him back to his native country of Denmark. It doesn&apos;t matter, though. This is the kind of isolated little village that can be found anywhere in the world.\n\n&quot;The Hunt&quot; was easily the saddest film I&apos;ve seen all year but in a cathartic way that only a great work of art can accomplish. It&apos;s a gritty and hard-hitting statement on our judgmental society that pulls no punches in its recounting of a controversial ripped-from-the-headlines story, repeated all too often in recent history, that&apos;s both poignant and polarizing in its authenticity.\n\nIt was difficult for me to hold back tears during the screening. I broke down several times. Many will be touched by certain scenes more than others, but &quot;The Hunt&quot; is one of the most affecting and emotional films I&apos;ve ever seen and one of the best of 2012.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;ve heard so much told about Citizen Kane and Orson Welles, so I finally decided to get the film, and find out if it really is all that it&apos;s cracked up to be... I must say, it&apos;s great. The plot is great, and the way it&apos;s told is amazing. The story is first summed up in a matter of minutes, about 15, to be more accurate, and then the rest of the film has characters telling the story through flashbacks and retelling. We hear just about every opinion about Charles Foster Kane, apart from his own. The story is told after his death, and we see everything important that leads up to it, and only in the very end do we understand him, only then do we fully understand who he was, and what made him so. The ending also reveals one of the very most important things in any man or woman... one thing that everyone needs and knows of. I won&apos;t reveal it here, as it would almost be a crime to spoil the experience of this film to anyone. The acting is excellent; Welles himself is stellar as Kane, and his impressive appearance, along with his commanding voice, makes the character a forceful sight, nay, experience. The characters are well-written and credible. The character of Kane is probably the most well-rounded and perfectly built up I&apos;ve seen in a movie, ever. The cinematography is excellent... the editing is great. I can&apos;t praise the angles, pans, zooms and transitions enough... it just has to be experienced. Now, for the one thing I can criticize in the film; the pacing. It&apos;s only two hours long, but it feels like much, much more. There were portions of the film where it felt like it didn&apos;t move at all. When there weren&apos;t great dialog or something equally as good in the film, it dragged terribly. There were too many scenes where the dialog seemed pointless, as well, I think. It didn&apos;t seem to be leading to anything. However, this criticism is so minor, due to the ending more than making up for it, that I still give this film a perfect score. I can&apos;t do anything but agree with its placing at the top of the top #250 films of all time, here on IMDb. As I&apos;m writing this, it&apos;s #11. That&apos;s pretty much what it deserves, in my opinion. Not higher, not lower. Not the greatest film of all time(that pretty much still belongs to The Godfather, I think... at least, I haven&apos;t seen a better film than that, yet), but definitely far up there. I recommend this to any fan of film in general, and anyone who thinks they can understand it; it has a truly profound point that any man(and woman) should know of(preferably through seeing the film for themselves). Don&apos;t let the fact that it&apos;s old and black &amp; white deter you from seeing this masterpiece. A true cinematic masterpiece, in every sense of the word. 10/10",

      "reviewBody": "There&apos;s only one way to describe &quot;Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind&quot;: perfect. It&apos;s been one week since I saw the movie and I still cannot stop thinking about it. Was the ending happy or sad? I cannot tell, but it&apos;s deeply touching.\n\nCharlie Kaufman is incredible. How does he come up with all these original, flawless scripts? Finally there&apos;s someone who uses the possibilities of cinema to the fullest. I love the way Kaufman shows the fate of individuals and derives universally true rules from it. The content of his story is always highly philosophical without ever being smart alec.\n\nSome say &quot;Eternal Sunshine...&quot; was over-directed. I disagree. Having read the script, I know that Gondry deserves lots of credit for bringing this beautiful story to life. Sure, there are five creepy images per minute, but have you ever seen such an original, weird picture? Mind you, I&apos;m not saying that lots of effects automatically make for a good direction, but in this case it really helped to underline the story, not distracting from it.\n\nJim Carrey... wow! I&apos;ve always liked him as the hilarious Comedian he is, but I never thought that his performances in &quot;The Truman Show&quot; and &quot;Man On The Moon&quot; were that much of a departure from his funny-man side. As Joel, however, he is a completely different person. It&apos;s like Jim Carrey had a serious twin brother. Unbelievable. I bow to this performance! Give this man more chances to show his acting abilities, I say!\n\nFinally I have to mention Beck&apos;s cover of &quot;Everybody&apos;s Gotta Learn Sometime&quot;, which fits perfectly into the movie and won&apos;t leave my CD-Player for the next months.\n\nA movie like &quot;Eternal Sunshine...&quot; really shows how much time and money Hollywood wastes on producing crap like &quot;Bad Boys&quot; or &quot;The Fast &amp; The Furious&quot;, and its box office result demonstrates how little people care about quality in movies. Personally, I have found my first contender for best motion picture of the year. I need to see the movie again, because I have a feeling that this one gets even better with each viewing. I can&apos;t wait until it&apos;s released on DVD.\n\nI feel the need to say more, but I can&apos;t put my feelings into (English) words. All I can say is: GO SEE THIS MOVIE! You won&apos;t regret it.",

      "reviewBody": "In post-World War II Italy poverty is a dire reality for a large portion of the population. Work is scarce and the opportunities for employment are few and far between. &quot;Ladri Di Biciclette&quot; (translated &quot;The Bicycle Thief&quot;) is quietly one of the finest films ever produced. It follows one economically distraught man (Lamberto Maggiorani) who is heading down a desperate path fast. Things look up when he gets a job putting posters on walls in town, but he must sell what few meager possessions he and his family have to buy a bicycle to uphold his end of the business bargain. Naturally tragedy strikes immediately as the title character shows up the very first day Maggiorani is on the job. The police are little help, believing the bicycle is not as important as it really is. Thus Maggiorani and young son Enzo Staiola take it upon themselves to look all over town to try and find the bicycle and bring the thief to justice. &quot;The Bicycle Thief&quot; was originally released in 1948 and won an Honorary Academy Award for Best Foreign Language film the following year (the movie was not released in the U.S. until 1949). It is still a production that strikes deep even today. The lengths and desperate measures that some go through is very evident here. Director Vittorio De Sica crafts a film that is much deeper than it appears on the surface. It examines the human condition and questions society, family, law enforcement, alliances and mental anguish perfectly. &quot;The Bicycle Thief&quot; is an excellent production that has aged well and allows the viewer to think about many subjects that go beyond ordinary cinematic depths. 5 stars out of 5."

      "reviewBody": "When it come to making epics, David Lean is the master and what better proof than this masterpiece.  &quot;Lawrence Of Arabia&quot; was first shown in 1962 and after almost 40 years later, it is still beautiful.  The story of T. E. Lawrence is wonderfully brought to us by David Lean, director of another masterpiece called &quot;The Bridge On The River Kwai&quot;.\n\nDavid Lean has shown us a man&apos;s long, yet never boring (at least for me) journey into the deserts of Arabia.  Lawrence (Peter O&apos;Toole) is an ordinary man that becomes a hero (at least in my eyes) during his extensive tenure in Arabia.  He becomes a traveler, a great man, and a leader to the people that he has associated with.  Only director David Lean could have given us a movie experience like this.\n\nAn assortment of phenomenal actors are collected for this movie and what a cast!  Peter O&apos;Toole, Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn, Alec Guiness and so much more portray their characters with intensity and believability.  Never have I been so impressed. As Lawrence, Peter O&apos;Toole plays the role of which his name is most associated with and is surprising for me that he made the role his own because before I got a chance to see this movie I imagined a man opposite from someone like Peter O&apos;Toole.  Omar Sharif as Ali is one of the most charismatic characters in film history.  I will not say anymore about the cast because I&apos;m allowed only 1,000 words to use in my comment.\n\nWill all do respect to classics such as &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot; and even &quot;Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;this is without a doubt the most exciting epic of all time.  I highly recommend it!",

That fact that it still entertains over 80 years after it was made is quite a testimony. \n\nIt is a wonderful blend of humor and drama. Charlie Chaplin&apos;s unique humor, combined with an involving storyline and strong sentimentality make this one to remember. Chaplin&apos;s humor ranges from pure slapstick to some clever stunts.\n\nThe &quot;kid&quot; - Jackie Coogan - is just as memorable, maybe even more so. He is unbelievably cute, especially in those old-time clothes he wore. Watching the expressions on his face, even as a baby, are fascinating and facial expressions certainly were a trademark of the silent era.\n\nSo, between Chaplin and Coogan, and a very involving story that can break your heart one minute and have you laughing out loud the next, it&apos;s an amazing piece of work. This is a very fast-paced story which lasts less than an hour.\n\nThe special edition two-disc DVD has a restored version of the print so the picture is very clear, actually astounding for its age. Excellent entertainment.",

      "reviewBody": "Aamir Khan shines in the role of Mahavir Singh Phogat. He is so outstanding in his performance that this could be considered as one of his best works ever. The opening scene of the film is just a glimpse of Phogat&apos;s passion for the sport \u2013 wrestling. The first half of Dangal works exactly like a skilled wrestler \u2013 invariably sure of its moves. The film&apos;s second half is all about victory. Mahavir&apos;s transformation from the once upset father of a baby girl to the most triumphant one to Geeta&apos;s string of losses before she finally wins a gold during Common Wealth Games to desi akhara being replaced by wrestling mat \u2013 every moment works in contrast to what you had watched earlier. But not even once does the film loses its focus.\n\nA word here about Mukesh Chhabra&apos;s casting: he has done a tremendous job of the casting. Nitesh Tiwari&apos;s direction is amazingly terrific. AmitabhBhattacharya&apos;s lyrics are great. Pritam&apos;s music is in terrific sync with the mood of the drama. &apos;Dangal dangal&apos; is a very inspiring song and will soon become a rage. &apos;Dhaakad&apos; and &apos;Haanikarak&apos; are also very well-tuned. The &apos;Gilehariyaan&apos; song has terrific charm of a different kind. Amitabh Bhattacharya&apos;s lyrics are great. The song writer may pick up some awards for his lyrics. Bosco- Caesar&apos;s choreography is very real. Pritam&apos;s background music deserves distinction marks. The actors who play the young Geeta and Babita (Zaira Wasim, Suhani Bhatnagar) do a competent job of maintaining the audiences attention. And both Shaikh and Malhotra carry it forward, especially when they spend a lot of the second half on the mat, learning how to lose, and, above all, to win. Since it encapsulates the historic win of the phogats who bought India glory so it is bound to inspire women. Dialogues are absolute gems. Without being overtly long, they are so effective that they invariably touch the heart before reaching the ears. On the whole,\u00a0Dangal\u00a0is not just a movie; it is an experience to be cherished. The film is destined to be one of the biggest blockbusters of Indian cinema.As it content oriented so The movie is both for the single screens as well as for the multiplexes and people of all age can watch.so this movie is a must watch. So I Rate it 10 stars out of 10 because I was thinking movie deserves it.I usually don&apos;t rate any movie 10 but This movie &quot;HatsOff&quot;. Don&apos;t Expect a better story than this.Finest piece.Dangal hai yeh.",

      "reviewBody": "In the beginning of The Apartment we see C. C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon) being lost in a sea of desks within a gigantic office room. He works for a huge New York insurance company employing over thirty thousand souls spread over twenty-seven floors. Sometimes he is working overtime; &quot;It&apos;s not like I was overly ambitious...&quot; Baxter tells us defensively. &quot;You see, I have this little problem with my apartment\u0085 I can&apos;t always get in when I want to.&quot; \n\nThe reason are several superiors, to whom he is lending his apartment for their extra-marital escapades. In exchange they promise to give his career a push by passing recommendations to the personnel manager, Mr. Sheldrake (Fred MacMurray). Although Buddy Boy (that&apos;s his disrespectful yet firmly established nickname) is daily surrounded by hundreds of people, he is drowning in lonesomeness. Apart from his mocking colleagues, there does not seem to be any family or close friends. In fact, the only decent person among his acquaintances is his neighbour, Dr. Dreyfuss (Jack Kruschen), ironically under the wrong impression that the man next door is a womanizing drunkard. \n\nSo Baxter meekly adapts to the mercilessness of corporate life, putting all hopes of happiness into his career. His free evenings consist of watching TV, preparing dinner or cleaning up after the occupants of his apartment. Yes, one could say that Baxter does not exactly lead a joyful life. \n\nYet, there is something, or rather somebody carrying light into the loner&apos;s gloominess when he falls in love with the pretty elevator girl Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine). Although Fran likes him for his decency and kindness, she does not quite share the feelings of her ardent admirer. But Buddy Boy refuses to notice any signs of unrequited love and eventually talks her into going out with him. You can imagine how Baxter feels when she fails to turn up, and how things get significantly worse when he finds out that she is actually having intimate meetings with the personnel manager Mr. Sheldrake in HIS apartment. The image of purity Baxter had of Fran is gone. On Christmas Eve, he decides to drown his broken heart in a bar while his apartment is occupied by the cause of his misery. But Fran doesn&apos;t feel any happier than Baxter, and with the depressing effect Christmas can have on the lonesome and desperate, the story threatens to take a turn into tragedy... \n\nIt is hard to pin The Apartment on a single genre. The sharp, witty dialogue as well as Jack Lemmon&apos;s hilarious mimic would hint at a romantic comedy. Yet, one cannot overlook the tragic elements which let us dive into thoughtfulness, but never too deeply. Then again the film works on a satiric level, operating as cynical social commentary on corporate culture in the sixties (which is not very unlike today&apos;s business life). The remarkable thing about this film is that these three qualities merge perfectly into each other without ever losing the balance. The Apartment is a most entertaining picture, sometimes rushing from one hilarity to the next, and then suddenly slowing down to leave room for contemplation. Sometimes uplifting, sometimes depressing, sometimes both at the same time. Billy Wilder mixed these contrary moods, and most amazingly, it worked out just fine. \n\nFirst and foremost The Apartment deals with loneliness and the everlasting search for unaccomplished love. &quot;I used to live like Robinson Crusoe. I mean shipwrecked among 8 million people. And then one day I saw a footprint in the sand and there you were.&quot; Baxter tells Ms Kubelik. Does any relationship ever work out the way one dreamed it would? Additionally the film points out how people let themselves be treated badly out of total lack of self-esteem. Standing up for oneself and saying the simple word &quot;no&quot; can sometimes be an art of its own. \n\nAs an able filmmaker and scriptwriter (together with I. A. L. Diamond, &quot;Some like it Hot&quot;), Billy Wilder once again produced a film classic of outstanding quality. I have yet to see another picture, equally consistent at providing such humorous and well-timed dialogues. The amount of memorable quotes is remarkable and the entire cast did a terrific job at delivering them. Moreover, Wilder chose to shoot in black and white widescreen, shining with beautiful cinematography, and thereby gave the film a very special melancholy mood. \n\nMaybe the greatest strength of The Apartment is its honesty. It doesn&apos;t lie to us by painting images of perfect love or of perfect people. Neither does it create scenarios of utter hopelessness. However, it shows us that although life can be unfair on default, everyone is responsible for oneself to work up the courage to achieve happiness. With the director&apos;s cynical, yet comic approach to life, the film takes itself serious and it doesn&apos;t. It lets us taste the bitter and the sweet, thereby lending itself a tone of reality. For that reason alone I don&apos;t feel cheated by The Apartment and its story never failed to cheer me up. Then again, I may be too much of a pessimistic optimist."

      "reviewBody": "Vintage Noir Film with gritty interpretation , atmospheric settings , crackling dialogue throughout and powerhouse filmmaking . This Billy Wilder&apos;s first thriller is one of the finest Noir film ever made . A scheming wife (Barbara Stanwyck) lures an insurance salesman (Fred MacMurray , though Alan Ladd, George Raft, Brian Donlevy, James Cagney, Spencer Tracy, Gregory Peck, and Fredric March were all up for the leading role) into helping murder her husband and then declare it an accident . Both of whom concoct a twisted scheme to collect the benefits of a insurance policy . As the hubby&apos;s policy contains a clause that states that if the husband&apos;s death caused by a moving train the policy pays double face value . The investigator&apos;s boss (Edward G. Robinson) , not knowing his colleague is involved in it , suspects murder and sets out to prove it .\n\nThis first-rate and entertaining American classic Noir film draws its riveting tale and power from the interaction of finely drawn roles as well as drama , emotion and moody atmosphere . This classic mystery thriller follows James M Cain&apos;s book fairly closely otherwise . Twisted film Noir about murder , troubled relationships , treason , dark secrets , including an unforgettable dialog ; being based on the James M Cain&apos;s novel , which in turn was based on the true story of Ruth Snyder, the subject of a notorious 1920s murder trial , being screen-written by the prestigious Raymond Chandler and the same Billy Wilder . However , Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler did not get along well while writing this film&apos;s script, a process that was apparently filled with arguments . As Billy Wilder didn&apos;t really get on with the famous novelist whose constant drinking irritated the director . It packs a good realization , an original script , haunting atmosphere , intriguing events ; for that reason madness and murder prevail . Fred MacMurray is superb as insurance salesman coerced into murder plot and Barbara Stanwick as predatory and alluring Femme Fatale is magnificent . Here his colleague Edward G Robinson is extraordinary and as cool as ever ; he plays as the astute and stubborn investigator , his scenes with Fred MacMurray are awesome and at their best . But Edward G. Robinson&apos;s initial reluctance to sign on largely stemmed from the fact he wasn&apos;t keen on being demoted to third lead . Good support cast formed by notorious secondaries such as Porter Hall , Tom Powers , Jean Heather , Byron Barr and Fortunio Bonanova . And Raymond Chandler&apos;s cameo , this marks the only film appearance of screenwriter and novelist Raymond Chandler .\n\nExciting as well as complex film , possessing a mysterious and fascinating blend of gripping thriller , serenity , baroque suspense in which especially stands out the portentous performances , evocative cinematography in black and white by John F. Seitz and thrilling musical score by the classic Miklos Rozsa . The motion picture was stunningly directed by the great Billy Wilder , as the American Film Institute ranked this as the #29 Greatest Movie of All Time . The film was nominated for 7 Academy Awards but lost out on the night to Going my way (1944) by Leo McCarey. It got a deep inspiration for other films , it is particularly obvious for \u00a8Body heat\u00a8 by Lawrence Kasdan with William Hurt , Kathleen Turner and Richard Crenna . Remade for TV in 1954 by Buzz Kulik with Frank Lovejoy , Ray Collins and Laraine Day , and 1973 TV remake of the 1940s classic by Jack Smight with Richard Crenna , Samantha Eggar , and Robert Webber .",

      "name": "The story elements are so familiar that you tend to forget some of them started here.",
      "reviewBody": "We have seen so many movies now that even those of us who study them tend to forget where certain familiarities were born. The science fiction elements presented in Fritz Lang&apos;s &apos;Metropolis&apos; are so familiar to us that they have become not just the genre standard but almost a given. The notion of a city as an urban hell ruled by the upper-class and operated by slave-like poor. The notion of the city that seems to touch the heavens. The notion of a mad scientist giggling in his lab as he plays God. The lone hero who discovers the diabolical machinations of the villain and tries to throw a monkey wrench into his plan. These elements can be found in this film&apos;s ancestors &apos;Frankenstein&apos;, &apos;Batman&apos;, &apos;Gattaca&apos; and the cities of &apos;Blade Runner&apos;, &apos;Star Wars&apos; and &apos;The Fifth Element&apos;. All of these films contain elements that were inspired by Lang&apos;s work.\n\n&apos;Metropolis&apos; has gone down in history as one of the most influential films ever made, certainly one of the most studied silent films and yet the movie sort of languishes. After its success in 1927 the film has had an uneasy time. It&apos;s pedigree as a silent film turns off the usual science fiction audience and it is sort of a footnote in the history of the genre. One restored version after another has tried to reconstruct the film as best it could because some of the footage of the film has been lost through neglect and silly studio censoring. Some of the restorations work but most do not so we sometimes wonder what an experience this must have been like in 1927. Unless a lost version surfaces (as it did with the recently uncovered print of Valentino&apos;s 1922 film &apos;Beyond the Rocks&apos;) the complete work my never be seen again. The restored version released on DVD in 2001 was based on a digital restoration at 2K resolution from all available sources. It&apos;s the best version that I&apos;ve seen and I would highly recommend that one if you haven&apos;t seen the film. The worst is a 1994 print put out by GoodTimes video which contains not an ounce of restoration, the film in grainy and difficult to see, it doesn&apos;t even have a soundtrack. I call that one the worst because I&apos;m still a little ambivalent about the 1984 restored version by Georgio Moroder with color tinting (good), sound effects (not so good) and a soundtrack that includes songs by Loverboy, Freddy Mercury, Bonnie Tyler, Adam Ant and Pat Benatar (yuck!).\n\nThose who study the film (myself included) find the story impenetrable. Some films you can easily decipher but &apos;Metropolis&apos; has a plot that is so maddeningly erratic that it&apos;s hard to pin it down as a whole. Many conceded that as a fault but I think it adds to the film&apos;s chaotic nature. It takes place in the future (restored versions offer title cards that suggest that it&apos;s the year 2000 but I don&apos;t go by that) in an overcrowded city with immense skyscrapers (the Gothic, sometimes grotesque architecture suggests that the buildings were constructed in a hurry). The rich in Metropolis are content with their lives, dancing in their penthouses and spending their money. The poor work as slaves beneath the city like cogs in a machine. Lang choreographs the scenes in the subterranean levels magnificently so that the workers are never out of step. They don&apos;t so much work as toil under oppression like Ramses&apos; slaves building his pyramids. The rich and poor of Metropolis are ignorant of one another. One person that isn&apos;t ignorant of the class division is Joh Fredersen a ruthless businessman who rules Metropolis from his office.\n\nHis son Freder happily enjoys the Pleasure Gardens one day when he notices a woman rising from the underground caves with a group of the worker&apos;s children. Curious, he follows her to the depths and is aghast at the tyranny in motion there. The woman is Maria, a revolutionary who holds sermons to remind the workers that a peaceful resolution can and must be found.\n\nFreder uncovers a plot by Rotwang, the mad scientist to create a robotic version of Maria to convince the workers to rise up and take arms. This leads to the film&apos;s most famous scene when the robot becomes flesh and blood and the false prophet opens her eyes to reveal two dead sparkling orbs. Rotwang kidnaps the real Maria and sends the false one to convince the workers to rise up and then taunt the rich men and drive them into a sexual frenzy.\n\nThen all Hell breaks loose, but the rest I must leave to you to discover.\n\nLang based the film on the book written by his wife Thea Von Harbou. In the book the story is about a chaotic as the film (and therefore less successful), the difference is that Lang has the visuals to suggest the chaos where the book did not. He uses every technical tool at his disposal to visualize the Hell of the subterranean machine run by the workers. At one point Freder, disguised as a worker, witnesses one of the huge machines explode and visualizes it as a horrendous monster swallowing workers by the dozen. Another suggests an odd device, a giant dial in which the worker is made to keep the arms in the same place as the light bulbs go on and off around it&apos;s edge. The machine doesn&apos;t seem to have any purpose until Freder imagines it as a giant clock and tries to pull the arms forward to end the merciless day.\n\nThe film is one of the pinnacles of German Expressionism, astonishing in its use of light and shadow. One of the best examples is the scene in which Rotwang pursues the real Maria through the caves using only a beam of light to strike terror as he closes in. Another brilliant moment comes with Maria&apos;s erotic dance as the men gawk, the camera filled with their moist eyes. This scene was completely removed after the initial release and not restored until home video.\n\nOther moments have deeper resonance. There is something unsettling about the hundreds of workers toiling in the underground caves. Walking to work they march with their heads down, dressed in uniforms and caps. It reminded me of the Jews being led into the Nazi Death Camps. There is a buried foreshadowing of Hitler. More obvious are Lang&apos;s biblical references. The rise of the city parallels Maria&apos;s retelling of the story of the Tower of Babel. The giant pentagram in Rotwang&apos;s lab as he plays God. The breathtaking image of the plague-bringer who comes wielding an obscene scythe. The very heaven and hell nature of Metropolis itself. There is even a Christ-like quality in Maria who gives her sermons and reinforces that indeed blessed are the peacemakers.\n\nThese elements and images are brought to the film because of Lang&apos;s insistence on no less then absolute perfection. He was known as a sometimes cruel taskmaster, working his cast and crew like a dictator. He cast some 20,000 extras (1500 of them for the Tower of Babel sequence alone) and worked them from morning till night. The water which covered the set for the climactic flood was ice cold. Many of the extras were soaked through from morning till night. Actress Brigette Helm was nearly killed several times, once by a fall and another by the fact that the bonfire scene was real! Helm was so rattled by her experience working with Lang that she thereafter refused to make another film with him.\n\nI could go on and on, this film all great films invite lengthy discussions. It can be seen in at least a hundred different ways, as a foreshadowing of fascism or the tyranny of communism or just capitalism boiling over. But when you get down to it the best way to view &apos;Metropolis&apos; is not as a film to pick apart but simply as a film of it&apos;s time, Lang created the story of a world gone mad while the world around him was going mad."

      "reviewBody": "Taxi Driver is one of the best films ever made. This is one of those films that you do not get tired of seeing and every time you watch it you realize a little detail that you have not seen before. Excellent actors, a good director, an impressive soundtrack and a real story are the main appeals of this film.\n\nThis film is about loneliness, about the isolation of a man in a society full of scum. His objective is to finish with the scum of the streets. The story uses a taxi driver as a metaphor of loneliness and it has some kind of irony because we can see that a city which is full of people can be the most lonely place for a man. The long nights in the city, the night environment full of whores, junkies, pimps and thieves are the main elements of the world in which Travis Bickle lives. Travis is an misunderstood guy who is seeking desperately for some kind of company because as he says &apos;loneliness has followed me all my life, everywhere&apos; but at the same time he seems not to do anything to avoid his situation and it is seen when he goes with Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) to a porn cinema. At the end of the film the character makes real his most violent fantasies, with a look of certain soldiers from Vietnam, and he behaves like this because of his loneliness, his alienation and because he does not find any sense to his life. The violent behaviour becomes Travis into a hero, although he had killed many people and he could do it again. Although he acts with an extreme violence the spectator understand him and the reasons why he acts that way. The soundtrack of the film, which is composed by Bernard Herrmann, inspires some kind of loneliness and sometimes it is absolutely terrifying like in a horror film. This music and the slow camera showing the streets help to introduce the spectator into the world of Travis, to know what he is thinking about.\n\nIn general I cannot say any negative aspect of this film because I have not found anything bad. Although it is a film of the 70s it is not an old-fashioned movie because the essence of the story, the reality that is shown on it, can be perfectly referred to the current society. This film has the privilege of having made famous the sentence \u0091You talking&apos; to me? You talking&apos; to me?&apos; which will remain in the history of cinema. This is an authentic masterpiece."

The editing is pin sharp and beautifully cast with a superb musical track to keep you company. The framing, the photography, the pace all dovetail exquisitely and if you feel left outside of the game plan in your first viewing, never fear, the second time of watching, you&apos;ll enjoy it just as much but it will mean more. Certainly it&apos;s a film you&apos;ll want to see a second time. At least. Oscars rightly by the handful and nominations are full deserved to combine for a winning performance by all concerned. Definitely in my top fifty of all time."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Scarface&quot; has a major cult following even now, 22 years after its release.\n\nIt has also been widely criticized as being very tacky, unrefined, over-the-top and all bloated up! These are people who compare Scarface to The Godfather movies. It is true that on the technical front, (cinematography, screenplay, direction, etc.) Scarface is way behind &apos;The Godfather&apos;.\n\nBut it is also true, that what Scarface has and some other gangster movies lack, is the rawness, the sheer crude approach of the gangsters. The Latino gangsters in this movie look much more menacing and real than any of the polished Italian or Irish gangsters from other gangster classics like &apos;The Godfather&apos; or &apos;Goodfellas&apos;. This is one of the major winning points of Scarface and I strongly believe that this fact has been written off as &quot;tackiness&quot; by most critics! I have seen the original 1932 Scarface, and I must say that both these movies are way too different from each other and should be seen as two different movies instead of praising the original over the &quot;remake&quot;! \n\nAl Pacino has been criticized to be over-the-top and loud in this movie. But how about considering that that is precisely the way the film-makers wanted Tony Montana&apos;s character to be! He is this angry young man who takes hasty decisions and throws fits of tantrum every other minute! He is not the calm Michael Corleone here. He is Tony Montana, a very tacky, uneducated individual who doesn&apos;t really think much and gets angry all the time!\n\nThere is definitely a very 80s feel to this movie. The soundtrack is all 80s! I love some of the songs, including &apos;Gina and Elvira&apos;s theme&apos;, &apos;Push it to the limit&apos; and the title track instrumental.\n\nThere are some memorable and beautifully shot sequences, including the famous chainsaw scene, the Rebenga hit, the first meeting with Sosa and Tony&apos;s visit to his mother&apos;s.\n\nAbout the performances: Al Pacino is brilliant as the angry Cuban refugee. He has reportedly mentioned that he enjoyed playing Tony Montana the most in his entire career. And it really does seem like he has enjoyed himself thoroughly in all his scenes! One wonders what &quot;Scarface&quot; would be like without Pacino. I just couldn&apos;t imagine anyone else portraying Tony Montana and in all probabilities, the film wouldn&apos;t be as effective without him!\n\nSteven Bauer shines as Tony&apos;s friend Manny.\n\nRobert Loggia is wonderful as Tony&apos;s boss, Lopez. So is F. Murray Abraham (as Omar) in a small role.\n\nThen there is some eye-candy in the form of Elvira played by Michelle Pfeiffer. She looks beautiful and is adequate in her role.\n\nThe director does go a bit overboard during a particular part in the climax. Without revealing anything, I would only say that that was the only little part that suffers due to improper handling.\n\n&quot;Scarface&quot; is definitely one of the most entertaining and one of the best gangster movies to ever come out. Enjoy it for what it is: a raw portrayal of the Drug Lords and their gangland!",

Guy Richie has followed the success of Lock, Stock with an equally stunning and ambitious return just as Tarantino did with Pulp Fiction. The characters are so colourful they jump right off the screen, the dialogue so snappy you want to learn it by heart and the acting simply wonderful. Vinnie Jones reveals he can act and Brad Pitt shows that he is far more than a pretty face and could well win a best supporting actor oscar for his role as Irish Mickey. See this movie!!!!"

      "reviewBody": "To start off with, I heard a lot of good things about this movie when it was on the big screens but never got around to see it before it disappeared. Sitting here, long after in the aftermath, I might never forgive myself for missing that opportunity. Eventually I did get around to see it, though a small TV never does a film the same justice a theater does, and being a bit sceptic about the small hype this movie caused made me prejudice about it, but I must say I have never been so wrong before. And I am happy saying it.\n\nThis movies biggest crime, and yet its biggest asset, is that it is in French. Subtitles just does not bring full justice to a movie like this, and it is bound to scare off most of the audience not used to subtitled movies. Sad to say so, but I believe it is the truth. I do not know any French at all, but I sure wish I was fluent watching this movie!\n\nCompared to most other films &quot;Amelie&quot; (and I will stick to &quot;Amelie&quot; since &quot;Le Fabuleux destin d&apos;Am\u00e9lie Poulain&quot; is a bit long to write) is based on a rather ordinary and plain story everyone can relate to, but it is given to us in a very special kind of way, mixed with wonderful little subplots and an almost chaotic amount of details. We get to see and experience the world and especially Paris through the filtering eyes and fantasy of Amelie, A Paris that might feel small and limited on the screen but in fact is just as big as it is in the eyes of Amelie.\n\nDirector Jean-Pierre Jeunet brings to life the world of Amelie with colors, masterful camerawork and a few special effects (Well, I have certainly felt like melting a couple of times too in my life!). Some people I spoke to before seeing &quot;Amelie&quot; criticized it for being too childish and unrealistic, but I believe it is an essential part of the movie since Amelie herself is a very childish and imaginative young girl. She just happens to fall in love one day when she decides to embark on a quest. Jean-Pierre Jeunet manages to bring us along without losing control of the set or the plot. It is exactly this kind of movie that could easily be overdone and lose all of its magic in the hands of the wrong person, but Jean-Pierre Jeunet never slips a single time. For you who think you never heard of him before he is actually the same man who brought us &quot;Alien 4&quot; back in 1997, (I still refuse to believe he was involved in that horrible film...), and the wonderful &quot;Delicatessen&quot; in 1991.\n\nAudrey Tautou could not be overemphasized for her importance in portraying Amelie. I am a bit embarrassed admitting it but I was almost falling in love with Amelie myself, forgetting she was only fiction on the screen. However she does not carry &quot;Amelie&quot; solely by herself. The cast makes an excellent whole and it is hard imagining switching anyone without affecting the whole outcome. Everyone manages to make the most out of their role and even though we only get to know some of them briefly they come alive just as much as Amelie herself does.\n\nI could go on forever about &quot;Amelie&quot;. It contains so many details and switches in tempo and camerawork it has to be seen more than once to take in and understand everything. Damn it, &quot;Amelie&quot; made me happy, laughing out loud at times, and very few movies affects me like that.\n\nI very rarely give movies a 10, and I was indeed considering a 9 for a while, but for me this is one of those movies I will come back to time after time. Long after the CG thrills of hyped fantasy movies and big budget Hollywood productions have faded and been forgotten, Amelie will still be jumping around in my heart, doing all those silly and charming little things I wish I dared to do too...",

I probably cannot make any statement about this film that has not already been made many times, but it really is one of the most beautiful and moving films I have ever seen.  \n\nI first read Harper Lee&apos;s lovely novel when I was a young teen, and it was one of those books that gave me an experience that changed the way I perceived the world and my own family.  The movie stays true to the wonderful, innocent prose.\n\nEvery time I watch, I see my father in Atticus Finch.  He, too, is a southerner who respects people and defends his beliefs.  He also has always respected his children and treated us the way Atticus treats Scout and Jem. I also see other family and friends in various characters in the film, because we have such strong southern roots.  Even the negative aspects of racial antipathy and loss of childish innocence bring certain memories to mind.  \n\nThose who did not grow up in the south or with southern families might not see parallels the way I do, but the movie would be a gem to anyone.  Gregory Peck put in the performance of his career, and the children acted in the least forced manner I have ever seen.  The cinematography is also beautiful, and the script is perfectly balanced-not too sparse, but also not dialogue heavy.\n\nThe best thing about &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is that it preserves the spirit of the novel that resounds with so many people.  This film stands as one of the best ever arguments for tolerance, loving families, and the beauty of life through a child&apos;s eyes.  Everyone who watches movies ought to see it."

      "reviewBody": "The only Disney movie I cried in was Lion King. The other Disney film that came close was Pixar&apos;s WALL E. I did not cry during Toy Story 3. I went home walked into my room a realized that my Optimus Prime is not at the foot of my door, my Sylvester the Cat stuffed toy was not on my bed, and my McDonald&apos;s Sonic the Hedgehog toy was not on my shelf. My conner only housed my stack of video games. I asked myself why did my mother give away my toys without my permission? At THAT moment is when I thought about the last 30 minutes of Toy Story 3 I started to cry. This film was a carelessly thoughtful stoke of genius! It keeps both children and adults entertained. Lots of drama, lots suspense, and lots of toys! Disney and Pixar outdid themselves with this one. Toy Story was a smash hit when it first hit the screens. Toy Story 2, in my opinion, was not as good as its first installment but it was a film that almost never hit theaters so I&apos;ll give them the benefit of doubt. But Toy Story 3 set the bar &quot;to infinity and beyond!&quot; The VA cast was pheNOMenal. The visuals were stunning! The script was enjoyable! This movie reached all corners of film greatness (and its a kid&apos;s movie). I have no idea how Disney and Pixar knock out great movies like this (they make it look easy). I related to Andy in this film just as I did in Toy Story 3. The ending was so tough to watch without sniffling because if you watched Toy Story at around Andy&apos;s age during the time and you watch Toy Story 3 around Andy&apos;s age now (he was 17 and I am 22 and went through roughly the same hassle as he did when he was moving out for college), you would feel a wallop of emotion. Toy Story 3 is a MUST SEE. If you don&apos;t have children to take to go see this film then take friends who saw the first two films.",

      "name": "Imaginative, fun and moving - as close to perfect as Pixar has ever been",
      "reviewBody": "Carl Frederickson (Ed Asner) has lived a long life, but dreams of adventuring to South America. He wants to spend his remaining days in his home, but new high-rises are being constructed around it. After a chance accident, Carl loses his home, and is set to be taken into a retirement home. Unhappy with this idea, the former balloon salesman ties thousands of balloons to his house and simply floats away, en route to his dream adventure. Except, he is not alone \u2013 young &quot;wilderness explorer&quot; Russell (Jordan Nagai) inadvertently shows up in mid-air, and Carl sees no other choice but to bring the boy with him.\n\nThe fact that this plot line is even relevant enough to get made into a movie is more than enough reason to praise Up. Ever since Toy Story, Pixar has consistently delivered the most radically original and unique ideas for animated films, and live action films. Sure, not all of them are as amazing as others (Cars is quite simply stale compared to the likes of Ratatouille and WALL-E), but there is something brilliantly imaginative and exciting going on at the studio, and Up is no exception.\n\nComing off the breakthrough of WALL-E, I was not expecting the same reaction to Up, but I was more than just pleasantly surprised. The film is hilarious, heartfelt, moving and depressing all at once. This may sound like it is an issue, and that the film has a problem holding its ground with its tonal structure. But instead, it handles it quite well; splitting the film into quadrants and allowing the themes and plot line to coincide with whatever emotional response the filmmakers are going for. And while there is plenty for young children to enjoy and take from the film, it is the older audience that will get the biggest reaction from it. There is a lot going on in the film, but it never loses its speed and never loses control of what it wants to say and do. It knows exactly where it wants to be and when. And where other recent Pixar films have failed (specifically in their lengthy runtimes and frequent need to drag themselves out), Up does not. It practically blasts its way through its beginning, all the way up to its ending, with time left to spare.\n\nWhat makes Up work so well, much like WALL-E before it, is the focus on very few characters. Where WALL-E spent the majority of its runtime primarily on Earth with its main character, a love interest and a cockroach, Up spends its majority with Carl, Russell, a &quot;bird&quot; named Kevin and a talking dog named Dug (voiced by co-director Bob Peterson). It does allow for more characters to enter in later on, but the focus never strays from these main characters. Some may say the film is trying to tell multiple stories, but as the film progresses, it is clear it is telling one story \u2013 the tale of a man who never experienced what he wanted the most. The film builds up Carl&apos;s backstory heavily in startlingly moving moments that surprisingly were surprisingly kept rather secretive in the marketing for the film. We know from the very first trailer that Carl is a fairly mean old man, but the film spends a great deal of time to develop him into an emotional wreck of a man.\n\nBut the real success of the film is in its imagination and adventure. While WALL-E is perhaps the most startlingly unique and original animated picture of the last decade, Up still manages to pack in a lot of uniqueness. But while WALL-E got caught up in its own environmentally sound message, Up sticks with being an almost straight adventure picture. It is frequently thrilling and exciting, and lets up only for a few moments at a time. For such an older character, the film really stuns with some of its fantastical ideas. Sure, it is obvious this is a film that could only ever be done as an animated film, but what it lacks in realism it makes up for in fun \u2013 something that has been sorely missing from the movies for years. It came back for a short while with the first Pirates of the Caribbean film, but the focus as of late for any film has been on deeply conflicted, depressing narratives. And while this film is struck with having some of the most depressing scenes the year has seen so far, it never wallows in the sadness. It throws the moments at you, and then quickly moves on. And as said previously, the tonal shifts work excellently in Up&apos;s favour.\n\nBut of course, an animated movie cannot work without its animation. While Up is not a breakthrough in the way other Pixar films have been, it keeps with the tradition of still looking stunning and leading the curve for computer animated films. It does look cartoony and fantastical in many instances, but this only continues to work towards it being even better. The locales are realistic looking; the dog fur is near perfect. For me, watching Carl&apos;s facial hair gradually grow in as the story moves along was simply amazing. The little details and minute perfections have always been key to the Pixar films, and Up is no different. Additionally, the 3D effects really add a layer to the film, and bring the movie to life (unlike other recent efforts like Monsters vs. Aliens and Bolt).\n\nI cannot praise Up enough. Words cannot do justice for how excellent the film is. Pixar continues to outdo itself year after year, even with their subpar films. While each film has their own flaws, Up revels in being as close to perfect as the company has been in years. I adored every minute, and look forward to watching it again with an even bigger smile on my face.\n\n10/10.",

This movie is as good if not even just a little bit better than the original. The interaction between Ford and Connery is amazing and makes for an enjoyable film. The action and story in this is great. This time (back to looking for Christian artifacts) Indy is out to find his father who went missing while looking for the Holy Grail.",

But not in the usual comic-book style of most films today.  &quot;Heat&quot; carries with it the moral values so many of us take for granted.  Although much in the film is morally ambiguous, one may find that even when all your life you&apos;ve lived on the other side of the law, you can still settle down and have a heart-to-heart.  When I first saw this movie I was sure it would be another violent crime movie that I would never want to see again.  I have since seen it 4 times and have a copy of my own.  The thrilling sequences and brilliant camera-work have you glued to the screen.  The exceptional cast of characters has you wondering &quot;who could be so lucky to work with them?&quot;. From the opening scene to the thrilling final scenes and everything in between (including the climax) &quot;Heat&quot; grabs you and pulls you in.  This is a true film masterpiece.",

      "reviewBody": "L.A. Confidential is, without a doubt, the best film of the 1990s, and quite possibly one of the best films ever made.\n\nAs with any great film, it all starts with the writing.  The story is riveting, the dialogue is smart and quite funny, and the characters are written in three dimensions.\n\nThe acting is phenomenal.  Perhaps a bigger tragedy than L.A. Confidential&apos;s loss to Titanic in the Best Picture race is that none of the three lead actors even garnered nominations.  Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, and Kevin Spacey are absolutely phenomenal; it is their characters that drive this fascinating story about police corruption in 1950s Los Angeles.  We get to know these people, to understand who they are and why they do what they do, and to root for them to overcome their imperfections.\n\nThe directing is fantastic.  Curtis Hanson doesn&apos;t shove anything in the audience&apos;s face; instead, he allows the audience to discover the film&apos;s nuances on their own.  (That makes this an excellent film for repeat viewings, you truly catch something new every time).  1950s Los Angeles is reproduced beautifully.  The editing is quick and seamless, the music is perfect for the film (Hanson should teach other directors how to do a montage effectively), and the cinematography is great.\n\nI can&apos;t find a negative thing to say about this film.  It&apos;s truly a masterpiece.",

Shakespeare wrote King Lear as a mirror on the human condition. We do not have to be kings and princesses to identify with the father&apos;s desire for the well being of his children, even if his own life was one of cruelty and pain. We see this theme throughout great literature and film. What Ran has done is to provide the viewer with many small moments within the pain to realize the beauty. Even the moment of epiphany for Hidetora, when his actions achieve his madness, is one of surpassing beauty. As the storm rages outside the small house of the prince he blinded, whose parents he killed, whose sister he forcibly married off, the simple sounds of the flute provide an intense focus on the here and now. It is at this moment when Hidetora recognizes that he himself sowed the seeds of his own destruction. There is no dialogue, no swashbuckling, just the terrible beauty of the music. As with many of Kurasowa&apos;s films, despite their epic scope, it is the small paint strokes that make up the master&apos;s canvas."

The camera wisely stays behind the samurai, played by Toshiro Mifune, so we cannot see his face or expressions. This samurai is desperate. Mifune has no master and no money. Kurosawa doesn&apos;t let you see his desperation, instead focusing on the back of his head and his profile to set up one of the most memorable characters in cinema history. The film has been copied many times, its practically the most influential film of the modern action genre. Yojinbo isn&apos;t action packed however, Kurosawa takes his time setting up characters and plot. The fact that this masterless samurai has deep compassion for strangers is different than most modern action movies alone. Toshiro Mifune is magical in the lead role. His presence is felt all throughout the film even when he isn&apos;t on camera. All film buffs should watch this film, it is a perfect example of a director and actor with confidence in their craft.",

The dialogue was well written, and the main characters were equally as loveable. Viggo Mortensens acting was only overshadowed by that of Mahershala Ali, whose portrayal of an educated african-american man living in 1960&apos;s america was both heartwrenching and absolutely hilarious. While Mortensen stood for most of the comic relief, I found myself laughing the hardest from Ali&apos;s deadpan deliveries through the character of Dr. Shirley.\n\nThe story of a black man who struggles to gain the respect of his fellow african-americans, while simultaneously resisting and pulling at the roots of the racism and oppression which keeps him from being as successful as the americans and europeans who should be his equals by all measures musical and educational.\n\nWhile the story and plot left little to be desired. I felt one or two jokes were shoe-horned in and would have been better discarded. The visual tone was fitting to the film, but the camerawork was nothing out of the ordinary. Not all films call for out-of-this-world originality in all marks however. And this film allows the audience to focus on what is really important.",

And not only Bruno Ganz has done a great performance, the entire cast gives it all their best. Very good film indeed.\n\nAs I said, it&apos;s a film about Adolf Hitlers final days, trapped in a bunker in Berlin, while the Russians are slowly moving closer. Hitler losing his faith in a &apos;good&apos; outcome, the final bullet, everything is has happened for real. But when I left the cinema I had the idea I had just been watching a fictional story. A perfect script, made in real life 59 years ago. Not much to say about anything else. If you are interested in WWII stuff, go see it in the cinema, it&apos;s worth every penny.",

      "reviewBody": "Here&apos;s perfect writing if ever a movie ever had it-where did Joseph L. Mankiewicz come up with these people? Who would have thought he could not only revive Bette Davis&apos; career with her greatest-ever role, but actually make her even more fascinating than she ever was before? Davis plays famous and established actress Margo Channing, a self-centred and tough but vulnerable woman who is purused relentlessly by Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter), a seemingly innocent woman who worships Channing-she even becomes her personal assistant. However, her devotion soon becomes sinister, and Margo lets her friends know, though they just think she&apos;s being selfish and unfair. Celeste Holm is excellent as Margo&apos;s best friend, who at first is on Eve&apos;s side but eventually sees how conniving Eve can be and how ruthless she is in climbing to the top. The party scene early on in the film features some of the film&apos;s best lines (`Fasten your seat belts\u0085it&apos;s going to be a bumpy night!&apos;), though my personal favourite is when Davis tells Baxter to put her award `where you heart should be&apos;; Margo Channing is just about the best female character of the fifties. Features Marilyn Monroe in an early role."

For many years I thought &apos;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&apos; was the funniest movie ever made. Now over twenty five years later repetition and familiarity may not have ruined the movie completely but they have spoiled my enjoyment somewhat. Even so it&apos;s still a comedy classic and I envy anyone who is watching it for the first time. Python (Cleese, Chapman, Palin, Jones, Idle and Gilliam) were on top form throughout, and apart from one or two less successful bits it&apos;s hilarious stuff, and arguably their most consistent movie. (I still think their TV work was their best, the non-linear sketch format suiting their style more than extended pieces). Python bores can quote this verbatim but don&apos;t let them put you off. This is one wacked out romp full of fun and surprises, and still has more laughs than 90% of today&apos;s so-called comedies. Highly recommended."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Movies should be like amusement parks&quot; filmmaker Billy Wilder once said &quot;People should go to them to have fun&quot;. So If Some Like It Hot was an amusement park: it would Thorpe Park, mixed in with Legoland, added with a dash of Disney land. Some Like It Hot is the granddaddy of comedies, the Godfather of laughs and the Mike Tyson of punch lines. Heck! Watching this film is like getting into the ring with Muhammad Ali, as you&apos;re constantly hit with fast paced gags. Even when you&apos;re least expecting it you&apos;re hit with a punch line so funny it leaves your side aching, or a piece of slapstick comedy that leaves your eyes running. Even the fade out line has been regarded as the funniest and most famous in history. Once you hear it, you&apos;ll guarantee never ever, ever to forget it. Trust me, it&apos;s hilarious! \n\nAfter playing witness to a routine gangland shooting, two penniless Chicago musicians, Joe and jerry decide it is the perfect opportunity, to remain safe and get paid a easy buck when they decide to take up residence in an all girl band heading to Florida, crossed-dressed as Josephine (Tony Curtis) and Daphne (Jack Lemmon). But with the only simple aim of getting paid and avoiding the mob, things soon get a little more tricky when a ditsy singer named Sugar (Marilyn Monroe) captures the heart of&apos; Josephine&apos; and a eccentric playboy millionaire falls for &apos;Daphne&apos;.\n\nSome Like It Hot is one of those rare occasions, where everyone involved is at the very peak of their powers. Billy Wilder&apos;s directing is subtle but instrumental in loading every scene with comedic material ready to pop out like a wound up jack in the box. The writing is excellent, it constantly moves at a furious pace. Imagine Usain bolt on roller blades with jet pack attached to his back, and still that&apos;s not even as fast as how the dialogue rips through every scene. People may say that the comedy is too high concept, but for me that&apos;s the very reason it&apos;s so damn funny , as well a begin genius, because it means that the jokes will stand the test of time and span all generations because it&apos;s so easy to understand. Anyway who likes having jokes explained to them? No one! \n\nBut you can&apos;t talk about Some Like It Hot, without mentioning Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon, who were absolutely perfect for their roles, each adding a feeling of assuredness to theirs, as well as bucket full&apos;s of originality with every facial expression as well as every line. Initially I was not convinced by Marilyn Monroe, as I felt she was slightly overrated, but in her role as Sugar, she brings a lot of composure to the role adding balance to the high energy of Tony and Jack, but still getting her laughs not through straight jokes but by simply being able to deliverer every air headed line with great delivery and timing. Whilst still being able to remain sweet, helpless and innocent, even as she plunges picks into a solid cube of ice with great fury, as she talks about her weakness for Saxophone players. \n\nSome Like It Hot it like a magician of comedy, you never know what to expect next, as with every new scene you so excitedly anticipate what piece of comedic magic it will pull out of its sleeve. For me Some Like It Hot is the funniest comedy film I have ever seen, even though it is almost 55 years old, its comedy is still so accessible and funny too!",

      "reviewBody": "I got a chance to see &apos;Batman Begins&apos; just this past Friday evening. I must say that before seeing the film, I felt in my heart this is the &apos;Batman&apos; film we&apos;ve been waiting for. Within ten minutes into the movie, I turned to my date and said to her, &quot;This is it! This is the movie!&quot; I just can&apos;t believe that after all these years, Warner Bros. finally got it right. For me the most intriguing part of the film, apart from the great script, and great acting, was Christopher Nolan&apos;s decision to base the film in reality. Deciding that Batman could really exist in our universe and our world was a stroke of genius. Another aspect of the film that&apos;s so refreshing is that instead of the focus being on the villain, Batman is the film&apos;s star. And rightly so. It&apos;s amazing what can happen when a studio leaves a respected director, and the creative team alone, and allow them to make the best movie possible. The only two negatives that I can think of is Katie Holmes and the fight sequences. Holmes does indeed look like a teenager playing grown-up. Her performance isn&apos;t bad per SE, it&apos;s just that you really don&apos;t buy her as an Assistant D.A. As for the fight sequences, I felt the cameras angles were too tight on the action, edited too quickly, and lit too dark so that you really couldn&apos;t tell what was going on and determine who was hitting who. Maybe we can attribute this to the fact that Nolan is not an action director. Hopefully the next film will open up the fight sequences so we can actually see Batman use the martial arts skills he developed during his exile. But apart from those relatively minor quibbles, the film is excellent, and I&apos;m definitely going back on opening day June 15th, and seeing it a second time. A third and fourth viewing is definitely not out of the question.",

The whole theme stripping away the mythology our culture has built around the west, scraping it away like the finish on a mirror and reveling the ugliness AND the humanity beneath. I was utterly convinced, both by the portrayal of the period and the reality of the characters. A large focus was its treatment of the subject of killing. The movie SHOWS US what it is like to kill a man, a stark stark contrast to the casual attitude taken by so many other westerns. We see what we already know, wild west or no, that killing is something that most people just aren&apos;t capable of. And yet the character of William Munny shows us that in spite of the mundanity he embodies in his later life, true evil still existed then as now, and every now and then, true heroism.",

      "reviewBody": "The wonderful Iranian film &quot;Children of Heaven&quot; and its companion piece, &quot;The White Balloon&quot;, remind one of those great Czechoslovakian films of the 1960&apos;s (&quot;The Shop on Main Street,&quot; &quot;Loves of a Blonde,&quot; etc.) in that they achieve their artistry by providing keenly observed glimpses into the minutiae of everyday life. They also help to humanize a culture often regarded as alien and even incomprehensible to western eyes. Above all, this magnificent film reminds us that real drama comes not in the form of over-plotted special effects-laden extravaganzas, but from films that examine the universal simplicities of life as we all know it. When it is distilled through the eyes of a poet - this is when art is achieved.\n\n&quot;Children of Heaven&quot; has its roots planted firmly in the neorealist tradition. Its simple story echoes not merely the earlier &quot;The White Balloon&quot; but the original Italian classic, &quot;The Bicycle Thief.&quot; In this film, young Ali accidentally loses his sister&apos;s recently mended shoes; out of this tale of utmost simplicity, the filmmakers take us on a fascinating tour of life in a typical Iranian village and family. As Ali and his sister scheme to overcome this obstacle, the film touches on any number of universal themes: the close ties of siblings united in their common bond of avoiding often irrational parental anger; well meaning, loving parents overwhelmed with the trials of everyday life who are often compelled to act out in ways that seem cruel to the children who adore them; the petty viciousness with which children often strike out at each other, yet, at the same time, the often unexpected kindness and empathy with which they also treat one another. The film manages to keep the audience constantly engrossed in its action without once resorting to even a smidgen of incredibility or melodrama. Beautifully directed, with a superb soundtrack filled with heightened naturalistic noises, it is a film of many-splendored wonders, its lyricism caught in a glimpse of soap bubbles floating around a backyard produced by two children abandoned to their moment of incomprehensible youthful joy, its high drama found in a shoe racing down a city sewer with a desperate young girl in tow.\n\nThe actors, children and adults alike, underplay their roles in so naturalistic a fashion that one does not even feel they are performing at all; the film, through them, becomes a magical fabric of life that draws the audience deep into its world.\n\n&quot;Children of Heaven&quot; brilliantly demonstrates that works of art often arise from the observation of the most seemingly mundane concerns of daily life and reminds us that this provides far more drama than all the exploding spaceships, car chases and hyperkinetic melodrama that flood the screen in the guise of entertainment. It certainly shows just how phony, empty and bereft of life most American films are. Don&apos;t miss &quot;Children of Heaven&quot;! It is a richly rewarding experience."

      "reviewBody": "I think this is possibly Miyazaki&apos;s most intriguing movie. All of his other films are very linear and even though their highly varied worlds may be visually stunning and highly creative, I feel the dreamy world of Howls Moving Castle is by far the most captivating, bizarre, and imaginative of all the worlds Miyazaki has ever envisioned.\n\nWhat I love about this movie is that it&apos;s highly emotional without a great deal of logic or plot or story to get in the way. In this way the film is simple, pure, and extremely beautiful. It is as if the characters go from one emotion to the next, in a world that is as random as one&apos;s own dreams. Some people have complained about the lack of plot or story or serious character development, but even though the characters are fairly static, their emotions and the physical changes they undergo as they go through these emotions brings out a higher truth that is seldom given such artistic and natural freedom.\n\nI think this is a very smart movie in many subtle ways and it&apos;s one that I look forward to watching again on the big screen and then on DVD. Although it flirts from theme to theme to theme with a kind of animated attention deficit disorder, the landscapes and utter unabated surrealism left me stunned and never bored.\n\nAlso, from a quizzical character design perspective, Howl is certainly one of if not the most beautiful characters that Miyazaki has ever created. Howl is an interesting departure from Miyazaki&apos;s more classical wabi-sabi anime style that most of his heroes and heroines are drawn in as Howl is definitely a very contemporary bishonen.\n\nIf you&apos;re looking for quaint settings, dynamic characters and a very involving character or plot driven story, you&apos;re not going to necessarily find them here, but you will find an equally stunning and pleasing movie if you let yourself go and enjoy this passionate, heartfelt and surreal Miyazaki dream.",

      "reviewBody": "The Wolf Of Wall Street details the rise and fall in real life of one Jordan Belfort who for a while was living high and wide off of other people&apos;s money. It was good while it lasted until some relentless FBI agents took him down partly because of his own hubris.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio as he did with such other real life figures like Howard Hughes and J. Edgar Hoover, each of who lived large in his own way with power, DiCaprio lives large with money. At first it&apos;s the realization of the American dream, DiCaprio the middle class kid wants to go on Wall Street. He goes, but then is one of thousands cast adrift by the stock market crash of the late Reagan years. DiCaprio is not about to give up his dream.\n\nHe organizes his own brokerage house, similar to what is seen in the more modestly financed film The Boiler Room. But DiCaprio takes it far from a penny stock outfit. With a collection of his own ill assorted bunch of friends chief among them is Jonah Hill, these guys and I do mean it is reserved for the male of the species DiCaprio makes obscene amounts of money and spends it obscenely. That is sure to attract all kinds of law enforcement attention.\n\nI have seen very few films that have depicted the alpha male world so well. Women just do not compete in DiCaprio&apos;s world. All they serve as are sex objects. Women work on Wall Street in the more traditional brokerage houses, but not with him where being one of the boys is the first requirement. The world consists of 50% orgies and 50% piling up paper profits and later on hiding them from authorities. True of DiCaprio and true to a lesser extent of all his associates.\n\nMartin Scorsese directed this film and handled the film like he did one of his gangster epics like Goodfellas. The narration of the film is by DiCaprio and it takes you from his rise to where law enforcement has him between a rock and a hard place. Like Ray Liotta in Goodfellas a combination of drugs and hubris makes him think he&apos;s invulnerable. But in Goodfellas would not have had a scene where the wise guys just out and out dared to challenge the FBI as DiCaprio does with agent Kyle Chandler. It so reminded me of that famous incident from 1984 where presidential candidate Gary Hart dares reporters to follow him around to catch him doing anything outside his marriage. And of course they did.\n\nFive Oscar nominations went to The Wolf Of Wall Street, nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and nominations for DiCaprio and Jonah Hill as Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. Hill was something of a revelation. The kind of nondescript character that you wouldn&apos;t look at twice, Hill gets taken to a world that he could only imagine in dreams wet or dry by DiCaprio. In his own Hill is almost as fascinating a story as DiCaprio.\n\nThe guy who beat Leo out for Best Actor has a brief but telling role as a mentor of sorts. Matthew McConaughey plays a stockbroker who takes him under his wing and they have a great scene at a club where he&apos;s getting his first three martini lunch. McConaughey only forgets to teach DiCaprio one thing, discretion.\n\nI can understand why women would truly hate this film as they are nothing more than pawns in a male power game, but The Wolf Of Wall Street gives us a fascinating look at a man who tried to play with the big boys of the Stock Exchange and for a while, did.",

      "reviewBody": "I watched &quot;Judgment at Nuremburg&quot; on PBS the other night. I had never seen it before. I expected an empty-headed, Hollywood-style, quasi-melodrama, but I was pleasantly surprised. Even Spencer Tracy, that universally beloved actor whose appeal has always escaped me, gave an honest and heartfelt portrayal of a &quot;simple man&quot; who was also a deeply conflicted judge.\n\nWhat I liked most about this movie was that it didn&apos;t pull any punches, in the manner of other &quot;controversial&quot; films of its time. The defense attorney, superbly played by Maximilian Schell, weaves a simple, but undeniable web of logic: \n\n\n* Sterilization of &quot;undesirables,&quot; one of the charges against the Nazi war criminals, was at one time condoned by the U.S. courts, and encouraged by none other than Oliver Wendell Holmes. - Numerous leading industrialists in the U.S. contributed to the development of the Nazi war machine. - Encouragement was given to Hitler&apos;s expansionism by both Russia and England. - Churchill is quoted as having admired Hitler. - The Vatican actively collaborated with the Nazis.\n\n\nCorrect me if I&apos;m wrong, but it must have taken major cojones to present that kind of message to American filmgoers in 1961. Would a film of that candor have a chance of being made today?\n\nI tend to doubt it. \n\nOne further note. The film describes how the Nazis went about stripping the German judiciary of judges who were known for their objectivity, and replacing them with judges who were appointed based solely on their party loyalties.\n\nThe mind boggles at the implications and yes, the prescience of this well-written, well-played masterpiece.",

      "reviewBody": "People did not like this movie for a simple reason: too negative. I can understand that this movie is so depressing in so may ways. \n\nWhat it shows that Big Fish eats Litte Fish and none of us want to think about that anymore than most of us experience it in our daily life. It shows the battle between the evangelicals and the corporate business man. Or maybe even the battle between evangelicals of today and the non-religious people or atheists of today. Even worse is that this movie shows that religious people, priests are or can be as bad as a corrupt oil man. Maybe why people did not like this movie is because it might have offended them. Especially Paul Dano playing the priest. Both Daniel Day Lewis and Paul Dano are wrong and too extreme on their opinions. People are able to accept this. What people cannot accept is though that these same extremities and same misguided opinions from both characters are very much true in that they are heavily believed still today. Not all Christains are like Paul Dano&apos;s character and not all business man are like Daniel Day Lewis&apos;s character but many are like them. That is the world we live in.\n\nNow is their any alternative or positive side? The answer is yes and that is H.W. the son of Daniel Plainview(Daniel Day Lewis). He epitomizes hope. He shows that despite being deaf and having a father who uses him as a ploy for better business he can still break free of the chains that he is being tied down by. What separates H.W. from the residents and evangelists of Little Boston? The difference is that he and his father are educated and they are not. That is how Daniel Plainview is able to manipulate and cheat them the Sunday family, even Eli Sunday(Paul Dano) the priest and preacher of Little Boston. From what H.W. sees and experiences he sees that much of what is around him is just wrong. He uses his experience that he had gained as a kid to break free of the corruption and chaos that could have taken over him. That is one aspect of the education I&apos;am talking about: our experiences and understanding of what is happening around us. \n\nNow to get to the technical aspects of There Will Be Blood. It is just truly spectacular in every way. First off the acting was amazing. Daniel Day Lewis gave arguably the best performance of his career playing Daniel Plaiview or ever since movies began to be made. He freaked me out and probably shocked many people. His thirst for power and money was at such a high level that it made me wonder about what people are really capable of. The deceiving, the greed, the thirst for power and the every man for himself attitude actually looked more real than ever to me. Without Daniel Day Lewis I don&apos;t think this movie could have achieved what it has. Paul Dano gave a great performance as Eli Sunday though people tend to disagree. I think he gave a great portrayal of an extremist evangelical priest of how he himself had his own thirst for power and how he was more blasphemous then respectful and gracious to god then how you would expect a priest to be. How could people not be shocked by these two characters, I was myself.\n\nWhy was the music for this movie not liked. I thought this was among the top five musical scores I have ever heard. The music perfectly gave you the feeling of the corruption and deception setting into the movie. It perfectly intertwined with the rest of the movie as the movie itself was ever growingly becoming more and more chaotic and surreal. Probably too shocking though.\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson I believe gave the best directing job of the year. He was able to show the oil fields and its processes, the rise of an oil man, the way everyone can be bought even a priest and the hope that H.W. represented. This movie was never boring and it was as stunning of a directing job as Daniel Day Lewis gave as a performance for his role in this movie. The intensity of this movie was as high as a movie could possibly be and some of the credit for this has to go to the director. The cinematography and the music seemed to intertwine perfectly like the rest of the movie. It gave the sense of the time period and as said before the greed, deception, etc. The cinematography did not just give you a negative feeling but a feeling as if what you are watching is real.\n\nYou should not like this movie just because of the great technical achievements as you should not for any movie but for what it says and how it says it. I&apos;m not even sure if you should enjoy this movie in general but you should not be blinded by your opinions. I applaud you whoever out there who can somewhat understand this movie and get past the lying and deceiving we do to ourselves. This movie really shows the humanity of human beings. Why is this rated-R?It has so many intense scenes that if you get inside this movie it is truly haunting. Now maybe this movie was too powerful for many people, it was probably even shocking for realists. Maybe though its not that surprising that so many people don&apos;t like this movie because the truth hurts. Not the truth about corruption or about people but the truth about ourselves.",

      "reviewBody": "I find it difficult to believe that some reviewers&apos; negative reactions to this film are based on their (misguided) beliefs that none of this could possibly have happened. Comments like these make it crystal clear that what some people don&apos;t know about history is appalling. If you are going to judge a film based on historical fact, it helps if you know what it is.\n\n It is well-documented what amazing technical feats the POW&apos;s were able to accomplish in the stalags. There was even an entire section of the British Secret Service dedicated to coming up with all sorts of clever ways to send these captured men the tools they needed to facilitate their escape attempts, i.e., sandwiching maps between the split sides of a record album (yes, the Germans allowed the prisoners to have records in the camps) or compasses in pens. At Colditz Castle, one of the more forbidding stalags, (actually an offlag since is was for officers only), many, many tunnels were dug and disguises created. One man actually created a German sergeant&apos;s uniform totally from scratch, donned a moustache and created an overall impersonation so realistic, it fooled two out of three sets of sentries. Some of the POW&apos;s built and concealed an entire glider that would have carried two men off the roof and over the wall! The only reason it didn&apos;t fly was because the prison was liberated before they got the chance! The Colditz experience is well documented. There are many books written about that particular prison complete with photographs, including one by a German officer confirming these amazing escapes and attempts. The reviewers who doubt what can be done when necessity is truly the mother of invention should look for them and learn something. \n\nAs for the prisoners not being in jumpsuits, as suggested by one reviewer as one reason to question the authenticity of the film? Ludicrous, POW&apos;s wore what they were captured in. The German military (different from the Gestapo and the SS) considered them soldiers and allowed them to keep their badges of rank.\n\nAs for the film itself, it is long, but absorbing. There are historical flaws (as there are in all movies), but several of the former POW&apos;s participated in the filming process, keeping it, for the most part,  very authentic. As for the emphasis on Americans, it&apos;s true they were not among the escapees per se, but several did assist in the effort before they were transferred out, as mentioned by a previous reviewer. However, you must remember that the movie was made for an American audience in 1963, long before international distribution revenue became so important to a studio&apos;s bottom line. They needed American stars who would appeal to an American audience. Who knows, perhaps if they were to remake it today, the cast would be all British and German, but I doubt it (see &quot;Hart&apos;s War&quot; where not only the plot, but all the British and Canadian characters that were in the book, disappeared).\n\nAll in all, &quot;The Great Escape&quot; is an entertaining movie telling a fascinating story of what ordinary men can achieve in adverse circumstances. It&apos;s well worth the time."

      "reviewBody": "What a fantastic movie, thanks to its cast, top heavy with stars and fine direction of the &quot;Oscar begging&quot; Martin Scorsese. Robert de Niro and Joe Pesci are great, as always, together. But, surprisingly, it&apos;s Sharon Stone that comes of with all the acting credit, she simply effervesces as the gold digging casino hustler. After witnessing her performance myself I couldn&apos;t agree more, and think she deserves a place above Susan Sarandon who &quot;stole&quot; the Academy Award from under Sharon&apos;s nose.  The photography is phenomenal and combined with great acting is a recipe for a classy film.  However occasional brilliant sequences, are often marred by the continuous commentary, which prevents any real, deep, emotional involvement with any of the characters.  Great stuff, just slightly flawed.9/10.",

There is never a dull or lagging moment. Three down and outers who at one time in their lives were maybe up and comers strike out in search of a fortune or at least enough to live better than they have been.\n\nWhile Humphrey Bogart gives a superb performance it is Walter Huston who turns in the greatest performance as the old prospector Howard. The scene in the Indian village where he helps to restore a comatose child is one of the most touching in all of film history and is done virtually without any dialog. Mexican character actor Alfonso Bedoya of course steals all the scenes he appears in and delivers his classic &quot;Stinking Badges&quot; line. (what person would dress up as a Bandito for a costume party and not want to look exactly like Bedoya&apos;s Gold Hat character?) This film probably should have been a little higher on AFI&apos;s top 100. A must see!",

      "reviewBody": "Whoever is dissatisfied by Raging Bull, I&apos;m sure they watched it with expectations of watching a sports movie, like Rocky. Despite the AFI chose Raging Bull as the #1 sports movie of all time, you can&apos;t expect to see the most breathtaking boxing match nor to witness the best crochet of boxing history. Raging Bull can only be classified as a drama/biography. Director Scorsese chose to go with black&amp;white cinematography only to keep the young viewers away from this masterpiece of art. It&apos;s not fair to compare Rocky with Raging Bull. Rocky was a populist movie mostly for young viewers, and Raging Bull is a cinematic masterpiece. From a wide point of view, for instance, if you look at one of the Michelangelo&apos;s paintings; at first you see a nude woman, if you look longer and deeper you realize that her nudity expresses some thought, if you look continuously and give a life to it in your imagination you discover that the women are not just their bodies. Accordingly, like it is not enough looking once to a painting to understand what opinion does it defend; it is not reasonable and not fair to watch Raging Bull so as to see a sports movie. Also it is not reasonable to see Raging Bull only once. Raging Bull is one movie that, every time you watch it you get a better taste, every time you watch it you discover something new. \n\nRaging Bull taught us that even if you are the best at some skill, even if you are the best of all; you need to create witnesses, admirers and supporters of your skill. It&apos;s the only way to reach the top. Moreover, it is harder to stay at the top than to reach the top. Not because someone better than you can defeat you, it&apos;s just because of the need to be accepted on every authority; like the Council of Judges, the Media and the Admiration of People. Director Scorsese draws benefit from the hypocrisy of fame. He empowers Raging Bull to make people ask to their conscience if the popular values that people choose can really cherish their values. \n\nIn Raging Bull, Jake La Motta was the best boxer of all, but people didn&apos;t like him. He was disrespectful, he was uncivilized, he was very ugly, he was arrogant, he was irritable and he didn&apos;t care; &apos;cause he believed himself. Despite the fact that he is the best, everybody disliked him. Soon, he was left alone; and in a very short time he lost everything he possessed. When he opened his eyes back to life, he found himself in prison. The scene that he is punching and butting the wall facing him is one of the most heart rending memorable scenes of the whole cinema history. \n\nAt the end, he finally throws in the towel of believing himself, he loses his faith and becomes to learn what he never wanted to learn: The Fame. He starts running his own business at a night club under his name, working as a stand-up comedian at the stage. People laugh at him for the jokes he made out of his memories, the jokes paraphrasing the bitter facts of life; including the very famous joke of the British King Richard-III which he said in the year 1485 just before dying: &quot;A horse, a horse... My kingdom for a horse!&quot;. There we understand truly: For every joke there lies a share of a fact underneath.",

      "reviewBody": "I knew CHINATOWN was hailed as the paragon of a film noir, and that&apos;s why I finally got down to watching it. However, despite having known about the movie for quite a while, I wasn&apos;t really prepared for just how dark it could be. The movie starts slowly, with a private detective taking on what looks like a routine case. But soon he finds himself enmeshed in a web of conspiracy, murder, lies and deceit. The plot is like a perfect machine that relentlessly moves towards a final resolution that is truly epic and truly soul-wrenching.\n\nIn a recent New York Times piece, they called CHINATOWN &quot;a meditation on evil&quot;, which is spot-on. Set in 1937, this movie is just all-round perfect, first and foremost how everything is connected within the grand structure of the movie, that is rich in themes (water, evil, trust, guilt, greed) and even richer in suspense, as the audience\u2014just like our protagonist\u2014tries to find out what is happening. The story is &quot;complex&quot; for sure, but it&apos;s not &quot;complicated&quot;. Everything makes sense in the end and the complexity pays off big time.\n\nBesides the impeccable screenplay, everything else about this movie is perfect as well. Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway carry the movie with sophistication and dignity. Dunaway&apos;s stunning performance in particular fills every scene with an aura of mystery as you are trying to find out what her motives are. The set pieces are beautiful, the score is compelling; and camera-work and editing could not be any better. There is a reason this one is called a classic! So, if you&apos;re ready to delve deep into a richly layered exploration of the dark side of humanity\u2014enjoy the ride. But don&apos;t expect to come back unscathed.",

But on a &quot;charming scale&quot;, this one is really the best.\n\nEven the Disney movies are not so charming than this movie. Poetic, charming, cute, I can&apos;t find the words to describe the good this movie made to me. Miyazaki brings us into the wonderlands of the children, better than &quot;Alice in wonderland&quot; or &quot;Peter pan&quot;.\n\nIn fact, Miyazaki makes us loving children. In the movie, the children run, shout all time, laugh, cry, and so on. In the real world, I hate this. In normal movies I hate this too. But, here, every actions of the two little girls touch us deep in our heart. We learn to love children&apos;s world.\n\nEvery one of us will have a smile on this face, from the beginning to the end of this movie.\n\nMy favorite scene is the first encounter between Mei and Totoro. It&apos;s fun, poetic, and charming. Miyazaki succeeds to make a movie enjoyable for the very little kids (4 y.o.) and for the adult audience. It&apos;s very rare to succeed doing that !\n\nReally, a masterpiece !\n\n10/10 !",

      "reviewBody": "Similar to my rating for this film, you can argue that 9 out of 10 people who watch this movie, it will not be their first Scorsese film. Most of us know the genius that he is and coming into this showing we should expect brilliance, and gladly he delivers a captivating storyline driven by great acting. Unfortunately with the release of Shutter Island was also a press release that Taxi Driver may be remade, so that news made me hesitant to care, but I&apos;m glad I was wrong.\n\nShutter Island is the story of Teddy Daniels, A U.S. federal marshall sent to the island with his partner Chuck Aule to search for the disappearance of a patient. Each scene provides a turn against their leads and compels them to look for more whilst searching in places we couldn&apos;t comprehend, including their minds. Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo feed off each other and supply great performances for their characters as expected, but some of the other characters whose names are riveted on the posters or marquees are sensational as well. The two that stuck out to me most were Ben Kingsley (Dr. Cawley) and Michelle Williams (Dolores, Teddy&apos;s wife), each of whom brought so much dramatics and new questions to the movie, developing plot twists and controversy. I don&apos;t think this film would be the same without them.\n\nEven to begin explaining details of the plot and how everything comes to fruition causes me to feel migraines alike the ones Teddy gets in the movie, therefore I won&apos;t ruin anything for you now. Take my honest word that if you enjoyed any Scorsese movie in the past or have enjoyed movies that include surrealism, Shutter Island combines the two into an intense thriller that boggles the mind and possibly even &quot;corrode it, rusts it&quot;. Also, if you are hesitant to watch this film because the trailer perceives it as a horror film with a lot of &quot;jumpy&quot; scenes, ignore that. I had the same feeling entering it, and there was only one towards the very end, but it was worth the shock. You will miss so much detail trying to cover your eyes for a few minutes sporadically throughout that it&apos;s not worth it. Take the risk of jumping out of your seat for once, because it was the best scare I could ask for.\n\n9/10. Not Martin&apos;s best work, but come on, could you make a better movie than him?",

      "reviewBody": "I was a total and complete sucker for this film.\n\nIf I were to write and direct a movie about gangsters or crime, this would be it.  I wouldn&apos;t change one damn thing.  Not a thing.  Everything in this film was, to my eye, perfect - casting, the camerawork, the excellent dialogue (&quot;It&apos;s been emotional.&quot;)\n\nNow I don&apos;t have much to compare this to, and I&apos;ve heard some criticism that it basically draws quite heavily from older British crime dramas.  I&apos;ve got a bunch of these on my queue to rent, but I doubt you could make a crime film better than this.\n\nThis film oozes with style, class, dark humor, plot twists and turns, and doesn&apos;t drag one bit.  The casting and characterization is perfect, and Ritchie isn&apos;t afraid to move the cameras around; no pretense is really made here at &quot;realism&quot; - Ritchie doesn&apos;t mask the fact that it&apos;s a film and he runs with it.\n\nI really don&apos;t think of myself as easily impressed, and I have seen a hell of a lot of films in my time, but this one instantly made my Top 10 after only a single viewing.  Yes, I&apos;m raving about it, and while it may not be &quot;spiritually enriching&quot; or contain any deep sociological content (which I actually do look for in films), somehow it still scores as one hell of a film; memorable and entertaining, and stands up well to multiple viewings.\n\nI am a bit dismayed to see some of the marketing of this film comparing it to other things like Quentin Tarantino films or Trainspotting.  It really does it a disservice because this film really is its own phenomenon and stands on its own two feet; if anything it is similar to  Trainspotting and Tarantino films only because it actually has its own bold style.\n\nCan&apos;t recommend it enough.",

      "reviewBody": "Opinions do look to be sharply divided on this typically interesting effort for the Coen brothers. Some hail it a masterpiece, others don&apos;t see the appeal at all. While this viewer doesn&apos;t quite fit into the former camp, he will say that it&apos;s one of the more unconventional examples of crime fiction that one is likely to see. It&apos;s much more of a character piece than anything, with some grisly scenes of violence here and there. Based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy, it centres around three characters, one being a poor hunter named Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), who one day stumbles into the aftermath of some drug deal gone horribly wrong. He finds $2 million on the scene and impulsively decides to keep the money for himself, while a mysterious, creepy, sadistic stranger named Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) tracks him down, porting a unique pressurized air weapon. Somewhat involved is a weary Texas sheriff, Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), who&apos;s unsettled by what he sees as the changing times. Now, granted, what&apos;s going to test the patience of some of the viewers are some of the monologues; this isn&apos;t for people who want a straightforward story and who are turned off by philosophical musings. One can hardly fail to notice how low key most of this narrative is; even in the more intense scenes there&apos;s never really a sense of urgency. On the plus side, what we do get are some excellent character moments from the solid star trio of Brolin, Bardem, and Jones. The supporting cast is equally impressive - Woody Harrelson, Kelly Macdonald, Garret Dillahunt, Tess Harper, Barry Corbin, Stephen Root, and Beth Grant. The Coens work with some of their reliable prior collaborators such as composer Carter Burwell and cinematographer Roger Deakins. All things considered, &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot; may not be to all tastes, and does require some patience on the part of the viewer. It also doesn&apos;t resolve itself in the way one might expect for this genre, and might prove to be less than satisfactory in this regard for some of those watching. There&apos;s one fantastic confrontation near the end, but the film closes, curiously enough, after a monologue by Bell about a dream he&apos;s had. How much or how little all of this works will be up to the individual viewer. In any event, the actors are all fantastic, especially Bardem, and they make the journey worthwhile. Eight out of 10.",

Grace Kelly, a peach as the unfaithful wife who stays home to cut newspaper clippings of her husband&apos;s past glories. Yeah, right. Robert Cummings has always been a mystery to me. A popular leading man with a long career. He only exudes a campy, if lightweight vibe that almost works in comedies and when he&apos;s in a supporting role - My Geisha and What A Way To Go with Shirley MacLaine are good examples. Here as Grace Kelly&apos;s secret lover, I don&apos;t know what to say. John Williams. very funny again as the Scotland Yard inspector, the same character to a T he played in Midnight Lace with Doris Day or was it his twin brother? In any case, no Hitchcock fan can afford to miss this filmed play, filmed by one of the undisputed greats.",

      "reviewBody": "The Gold Rush is pure gold.  It was Charlie Chaplin&apos;s third feature-length film, and marked his comeback of sorts following A Woman of Paris (1923), which he had directed to great critical acclaim but which had been unsuccessful at the box office because it lacked his signature character The Little Tramp.  \n\nThis movie should be counted among Chaplin&apos;s best and most enduring works; many people name City Lights (which I&apos;ve also seen) as THE best Chaplin movie, but The Gold Rush is still an excellent showcase for one of movie comedy&apos;s immortal geniuses.\n\nHaving first seen this movie years ago on TV, I saw it again in October 2003 as part of my college&apos;s silent-film class, on a poor-quality videotape that often prevented the other students and I from laughing at it because we could barely discern what was happening on the screen. \n\n Even so, I was sufficiently intrigued to buy the GR Chaplin Collection DVD, which has a restored silent version of the film that is so good I haven&apos;t even bothered to watch the 1942 sound version that&apos;s also on the disc.\n\nThe viewing quality of this restored silent version is excellent, although certain minor details are still hard to see, such as the faces of the cards drawn by the Tramp, Jim McKay and Black Larsen as they try to determine who should go out into the blizzard.  On the other hand, in the shot of the cabin teetering on the edge of the cliff, the viewing clarity makes clearly visible the wire used to pull the model cabin farther over the edge!\n\nAlso, the film seems to skip in the scene when the Tramp dances with Georgia, perhaps due to a transfer problem with the DVD.  But these are minor complaints, and certainly the restoration allows for full appreciation of the film.\n\nThe first half-hour of The Gold Rush is in itself worth the purchase price, as it contains some of the funniest scenes I&apos;ve ever seen in any movie. Even the throwaway bits, such as the Tramp trying to use a crude hand-drawn compass, are more genuinely funny than the extreme gross-out gags offered by most contemporary comedies.  \n\nAnd the shoe-eating scene is so famously funny that even people watching it for the first time may feel that they&apos;ve seen it already: this is in no way a bad thing, but merely reflects the fact that the best silent films long ago entered into the collective memory of our culture.\n\nI don&apos;t say this to sound pretentious.  I believe that because Chaplin had such influence on the development of movie comedy, that to a certain extent people today may take him for granted.  It&apos;s hard to approach his work with fresh eyes only because so many people have watched his movies for so many years.  \n\nFor example, before the success of The Kid (1921), Chaplin&apos;s first feature film, the movie industry doubted that audiences would accept a film that blended comedy and drama.  In The Gold Rush, Chaplin further explored cinema&apos;s potential to be comedy and drama simultaneously.  Only he could have distilled humor from scenes of starvation and struggles to survive the ravings of a madman.\n\nThe joy of watching this film today stems from seeing how well Chaplin, as both star and director, finds and maintains the right tone and style for his work, negotiating the fine line between comedy and tragedy.  This is most evident in the scene when McKay and Larsen struggle for the shotgun in the cabin and the Tramp tries desperately to escape the muzzle&apos;s aim: the sequence is undeniably hilarious, yet even today the Tramp&apos;s grim predicament is just as likely to horrify the viewer.\n\nOne pleasure of silent comedies such as The Gold Rush is that the lack of a soundtrack leaves more to the imagination, in the same manner that old-time radio comedy got laughs from funny sound effects that showed the audience nothing.  \n\nWhen Black Larsen sees the Tramp in the cabin, for example, he enters and slams the door, causing the Tramp to spin around in alarm.  This is the kind of joke that could only work in a silent movie, because no door-slamming sound effect could be quite as funny as the piano score imitating the noise, as rendered by Neil Brand on the DVD.  \n\nThe second act, in which the Tramp gives up prospecting, returns to town and becomes infatuated with Georgia, was probably inevitable, as Chaplin realized he couldn&apos;t sustain the entire film at the cabin.  Still, he must have drawn much of his inspiration from that one location, because he returns his characters to the cabin in the film&apos;s third act. \n\n I don&apos;t want to spoil the climax for anyone who hasn&apos;t seen it, but I believe that even today it remains one of the most vivid depictions in cinema history of man versus the elements, and Chaplin milked all its potential for comedy and suspense.\n\nMack Swain is hilarious as Jim McKay, creating a memorable comic image with his ridiculously small boots and high-domed fur coat.  Chaplin generously gave him some opportunities to be funny on his own in this film, just as he was content to let Jackie Coogan share the spotlight in The Kid.  From what I&apos;ve seen of City Lights and Modern Times, he was not so generous in his later films, seeming to think that he himself was the whole show. \n\n The Gold Rush may not be a perfect 10 compared to today&apos;s more sophisticated stories and special effects.  The ending is cheerfully cynical, improbably reuniting two characters and never revealing Georgia&apos;s true feelings for the Tramp.\n\nBut the bottom line is that The Gold Rush is still funny after almost eighty years, and that&apos;s a feat few comedies in any year can ever accomplish. Chaplin, in his ability to extract maximum humor and poignancy from his material, has no equivalent today.  What a shame.\n\nRating: 10 (One of the best movies of 1925.)",

      "name": "&quot;The Thing&quot; is John Carpenter&apos;s masterpiece and one of the best classic horror films!",
      "reviewBody": "A classic film. John Carpenter&apos;s &quot;The Thing&quot; is one of the most entertaining horror films ever made - fast, clever and purely exciting from start to finish. It is one of my personal favorite horror movies. This is how all movies of the genre should be made. Set on an isolated base in Antarctica, this version seems almost to pick up where the original version (The Thing From Another World) left off. The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base some miles distant. Everyone is dead, and only the half charred remains of some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might offer any answers to what may have happened. The Thing is brought back to the American base and, too late, the scientists realize that it is alive and lethal. The Thing thaws out and is off, not only killing anyone and anything that crosses Its path, but also absorbing them, making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants. The film then turns into a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspect, anyone can be The Thing, and no one trusts anyone anymore. Gone is the strength and security found when human beings band together in spite of their differences to battle a monster. The group splinters and fear rules supreme. Who is the Thing?\n\nSeriously I Love this movie I love it To Death. I love Escape From New York and I love Escape From L.A. but I also love The Thing so much better this is definitely the best Carpenter film a truly masterpiece classic I love R.J. MacReady - Kurt Russell I love everything about this film that is. Science Fiction, Horror and an Action Epic Film. A lot of the practical effects were left out but the it looked nice and the acting was good and it expanded upon the monsters background and showing you the inside of the ship. It must of been tough to bring across on screen the visual design. \n\nIn my opinion, nobody has topped this film in the 25-odd years since its release. I&apos;ll put any of &quot;The Thing&apos;s&quot; old-school effects up against any CGI-driven movie, or this cast against almost any other ensemble. If you haven&apos;t seen the film yet, I envy you because I WISH I could see &quot;The Thing&quot; again for the first time. WOW! Does more need to be said? How about this...there is no parallel. Who&apos;s your friend? Who&apos;s the Thing? Who do you trust? Who can you afford to trust? If you&apos;ve never seen this movie...your in for a treat. The only other movie that had such an impact on me was The Matrix (the first movie)...where I left the theater touching the walls wondering if they were really real. This movie will leaving you wondering....is the guy/gal next to you really real?\n\n&quot;Trust is a tough thing to come by these days.&quot; \n\nJohn Carpenter&apos;s The Thing is a seminal piece of horror that is not only a fine specimen of its era, but it also serves as a shining example of horror done absolutely right in any era. Combining gross-out special effects reminiscent of Hellraiser, the nail-bitingly intense, claustrophobic filmmaking of Alien, offering a story that is very well-paced, such as George A. Romero&apos;s Dawn of the Dead, and presenting the idea that true terror can be found at any time, in any place, and inside anyone, much like Alfred Hitchcock&apos;s Psycho, The Thing works on every level, and represents the peak of each and every aspect that may be utilized to make horror films effective. Granted, this amalgamation of styles is not the only formula for winning horror.\n\nThe basic plot about this movie is Horror-moister John Carpenter (Halloween, Escape from New York) teams Kurt Russell&apos;s outstanding performance with incredible visuals to build this chilling version of the classic The Thing. In the winter of 1982, a twelve-man research team at a remote Antarctic research station discovers an alien buried in the snow for over 100,000 years. Once unfrozen, the form-changing alien wreaks havoc, creates terror and becomes one of them.\n\nIt is one of the best favorite horror films of the 80&apos;s ever. I love this film to death. The Thing is the best classic horror film from master and genius John Carpenter! &apos;The Thing&apos; is classic Carpenter and one of the few remakes that is better than the original. Kurt Russell&apos;s characters: Snake Plissken, R.J. MacReady and Jack Burton are Kurt&apos;s best favorite characters he ever played. I also love the music score from Ennio Morricone! Awesome!!! 10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval",

      "reviewBody": "Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a dark comedy that has an a-list cast with names like Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson, Sam Rockwell, John Hawkes, and Peter Dinklage. It centers around Mildred Hayes, a woman whose daughter was raped and killed, and who believes that the local police have not done enough about it. In reaction, she erects three billboards outside of her town that send a message to the sheriff about the state of the investigation.\n\nWriter/director Martin McDonagh (Seven Psychopaths, In Bruges) has outdone himself with this one. In my opinion, if this isn&apos;t one of the top Oscar contenders come awards season, then Hollywood has officially lost its mind.\n\nBasically everything about this film works: from the acting, to the writing, to the direction. Mcdormand gives the performance of her career here, giving us humor through all the pain clearly shown on her face. Rockwell also gives his best performance here as a cop who isn&apos;t that bright and is more than a little racist. \n\nThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is probably the most unpredictable film of the year, and that&apos;s coming from a year that includes films like Baby Driver and Logan. There are scenes where you think that you know where the plot is going, but then midway through it completely flips the script. \n\nFor the entire run-time of this film, I was invested. It has the perfect run-time; it ends exactly when it needs to and there is not a scene that feels out of place. \n\nIt seems like one of the hardest things to do in film nowadays is to balance comedy and drama. However, this movie does it effortlessly. Each scene has just the right amount of comedy and drama, and sometimes, despite the fact that you&apos;re laughing, it&apos;s easy to forget that jokes are being made.\n\nAlso, the message that this film gives off resonates very powerfully with you after the film finishes. It makes you see the good side in humanity, despite our flaws. No character in this film is a clich\u00e9 one-dimensional shell of a person. Everybody has a reason for being there, which is more than some films recently have offered.\n\nThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is easily one of the best and most enjoyable films of 2017, and it will make you laugh, cry, and think all in one sitting. There are not any clear flaws with this film that I can find, but I am still searching.\n\nI give Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri an A+.",

      "reviewBody": "The mysteries of religion and death have long been a popular focus among artists of all media, including film.  And while many films question these mysteries, they seldom provide any real insight into the world of the unknown.  In Ingmar Bergman&apos;s THE SEVENTH SEAL, these mysteries are not only questioned; they are dissected, splayed, and scrutinized.\n\nTHE SEVENTH SEAL could very well serve as sort of a manifesto for existentialism.  Its deep acuity and haunting imagery is powerful enough to jar even passive viewers out of their complacency and force them to examine their own reality.  The delicately crafted story centers around a 14th century knight named Antonius Block and his ongoing game of chess with a shadowy, hooded figure: Death.  Bergman uses this allegory not just to personify death, but to illustrate the lengths man will go to in order to avoid it.  In the end, however, Death is a much better player than any of us, and though he may humor some of his opponents by letting them think that they have the advantage, the end result is inevitable: Death always wins. No matter how skillfully we plan our moves or how determined we are to win, we can never beat Death.\n\nIn Antonius&apos;s search for answers, he encounters a variety of very unique characters, each with their own outlook on life, death, faith, fear and love.  Their commentary on such matters is often dryly funny and always brilliant, continuously and effectively challenging our perceptions of the world around us.  For me, the dialogue was definitely the high point of the film, as it was extremely thought-provoking and carefully constructed throughout.  Almost every line spoken is, in one way or another, daunting and unforgettable.  J\u00f6ns&apos;s description of love as &quot;the blackest of all plagues&quot; is a quote that will forever be engraved in my mind.\n\nTHE SEVENTH SEAL truly is a remarkable accomplishment in the world of cinema.  It is a deep, mesmerizing, and darkly beautiful work of art.  More importantly, THE SEVENTH SEAL is one of those rare movies that doesn&apos;t just entertain, but also has the power to change the way one thinks."

I have Ran, Throne of blood, Seven Samarai, Roshomon, Dreams, Hidden Fortress, Jojimbo, Snajuro, Red Beard, and even &quot;Kurosawa&quot; the documentary. I guess you can say that I like his work. The &quot;Kurosawa&quot; documentary narrated by Sam Shepard and produced by thirteen / WNET I recommend for anyone at all interested in Kurosawa&apos;s films as it will really wet your appetite.\n\nOf all of his films, Dersu Uzala is my favorite. It is also one of my favorite films by anybody. It was done shortly after Akira had went through a very dark time in his life and had attempted suicide. It was his first film afterwards and the content of the film appears to reflect more than a little of his mindset at the time. Dersu Uazla is both a feel good film and also a sad film. It touches the way that people as they grow older have a more and more difficult time adapting to life as it changes and has its affect on them. The end of the film can certainly show light on the inhumanity that appears to be growing more prevalent in our society. But, I think what you remember from the film is the love between two individuals, and that is what feels good.\n\nMany of Kurosawa&apos;s films have a great deal of spectacle, and he is perhaps known best for his Samarai films. There is none of that in this movie. Dersu Uzala is a statement by Akira of life. Akira was fighting to keep making films and was not having an easy time of it. If Akira Kurosawa could not make films, he could not feel that he was living. As a result, he attempted suicide. He survived to make this film plus many others that we all enjoy today. Dersu Uzala may be the most important of his films and the one that shows the great director&apos;s true personality. Just perhaps, it shows more about humanity than any of his other films. Again, it is my favorite."

And then when the movie continues it is revealed that John is just a loving human being, who wants to be loved like everybody else, and you suddenly look at him and has a kind of sympathy for him.\n\nThis is a VERY VERY VERY strong idea in my opinion BECAUSE the movie shows us that we are not better than anyone else. Even though we think that the people who&apos;ve seen John as a horrible deformed monster were horrible, we were thinking the same way in the beginning of the movie. Because the movie introduced John to us that way. This teaches us that unfortunately we are not objective, we don&apos;t really check things out before we judge them. We base our opinions on what others tell us, and not on what&apos;s right."

Night Shyamalan takes his vision from the page, and carefully crafts a tale that completely absorbs the viewer.  As a result, we are treated to a wealth of emotion: fear, sadness, joy, confusion, and humor, each one a compliment to the other.\n\nHaley Joel Osment delivers, plain and simple.  By now, so much has been said about the young actor that any more would be repetition.  Needless to say, his portrayal of Cole Sear is remarkable.  His ability to communicate, through a simple look or gesture, the depths to which his character&apos;s soul has been thrust is what truly carries the film.  He succeeds at this task beautifully, convincing us while never going over the top; indeed, by the time Cole utters his now-famous line, you not only believe him, you are chilled by the fact that Osment the actor may actually believe it himself.\n\nBruce Willis turns in a stellar performance, complimenting his young co-star while never overshadowing him.  It is a tribute to his respect of the material in so much as he fine tunes his delivery to seem reserved, yet not too toned down.\n\nThe Sixth Sense is more than simply a wondrous two hours.  It has, in effect, created a new genre of filmmaking... the film is neither drama, nor horror, nor action.  Rather, it is a seamless blending of all three, a film that encompasses the best aspects of each genre, without being limited by the worst.  Hollywood has taken notice of this, and one can only expect a series of poor imitations to follow.  But at least they&apos;ll always have The Sixth Sense to guide the way."

      "reviewBody": "&quot;The Truman Show&quot; owes a lot to the direction of Peter Weir. Weir refuses to pump out the movies in a search for extra dollars. Instead he chooses wisely and directs brilliantly. Just by looking at a list of his movies will surprise and even amaze you. So as you would imagine &quot;The Truman Show&quot; is another success.\n\nTruman Burbank has the perfect life, or so he thought until finally his life long suspicions about his world begin to unravel. Even though the idea for Truman is not totally original, it is thought provoking enough and allows the audience to wonder, what if? If you think this couldn&apos;t happen, just look back over the years at the stupidity of the human race and think again.\n\nJim Carrey once again nails his role, as do the entire cast. It is rare he fails to perform at a level that perfectly complements the movie and its genre. This is something he does not receive enough credit for. Acting for a comical role or a more dramatic role requires no less effort for the performance to be spot on.",

      "reviewBody": "In the year 1993, Hollywood saw something unlike anything else, the film Jurassic Park. Never before 1993 had dinosaurs been so breathtaking and realistic on the silver screen.\n\nThe plot is very original. A group of scientists cloned dinosaurs, and are about to open an amusement park where people can see the dinosaurs. The creator John Hammond(Richard Attenborough) invites a group of people, along with his grandchildren, to see the dinos and enjoy a relaxing time at the park. Could anything go wrong, at the time it doesn&apos;t seem like it, but something else is going on. Employee Dennis Nedry is planning to steal dinosaur embryos. In order to do this, he causes a security breakdown so he can get the embryos and escape. He isn&apos;t the only one that can escape, as hungry dinos also escape. After this, everyone on the island is in danger, and loose dinosaurs are everywhere. That is where the fun in Jurassic Park comes in.\n\nThis is an underrated movie according to the IMDb ratings. It isn&apos;t even in the top 250. Today, people don&apos;t appreciate it as much, mainly due to the fact that other movies like it have been made. Growing up in the 90&apos;s, this was one of my favorite movies. As a kid, I only watched it to see the dinosaurs, as I didn&apos;t understand a whole lot of it. Today, I realize how great the plotting and suspense are.\n\nThis spawned two sequels. The second one wasn&apos;t bad, but the third wasn&apos;t very good. I would recommend seeing the second after this, but the third is passable.\n\nThe story is great, how at first we see how the magic was created, and then later we see the magic turn into a disaster, in which everyone&apos;s life is at stake.\n\nThe special effects are still good today, but they were revolutionary for back in 1993. The acting is good, and the ensemble cast is great. All of the action sequences are perfectly executed, creating plenty of suspense and tension.\n\nYounger kids may get scared by this, as I remember a lot of young kids being scared by it in 1993. If kids aren&apos;t scared by dinosaurs, they will probably enjoy the movie.\n\nI highly recommend Jurassic Park. It is quite underrated in my opinion, it deserves more credit than it gets.\n\nWatch this at all costs if you have somehow missed it and see what everyone was amazed about back in 1993.\n\nEnjoy",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Wild Strawberries&quot; profoundly moved me. The theme -- an old man coming up fast on death and wondering if his life has had any meaning -- is an old one for Bergman, and one which he explored ad nauseum throughout the subsequent decades. But here Bergman approaches the question with an uncharacteristic optimism and sense of hope. For once, he seems to come close to finding some peace with the unknowns of life that obviously preoccupied him as an artist, and the movie he gives us is sad but immensely warm; resigned but calm and reflective.\n\nAn unequivocal masterpiece, and only one of a handful of Bergman films (&quot;Persona&quot; and &quot;Cries and Whispers&quot; being two others) that don&apos;t drive me over the edge when I watch them now.\n\nGrade: A+",

      "name": "Vienna Without a Waltz",
      "reviewBody": "Although I am as old as this movie, produced in 1949, I have not aged nearly as well. This film, directed brilliantly by Carol Reed (&quot;Odd Man Out&quot;, &quot;The Fallen Idol&quot;) and written by Graham Greene, who created a long list of memorable cinematic scripts, ingeniously captures the prevailing atmosphere of disruption and chaos that Vienna, a once highly civilized city, experienced during the years that followed World War II. The upheaval is physical, social, economic, political, moral, spiritual. You name it. Vanquished Vienna, conquered by the Allies, was crippled by turmoil in every imaginable way, and we viewers are given the opportunity to experience it up close, right here.\n\nI spent a number of months in Europe after I graduated from college in 1971. Although the war had been over for more than 25 years by then, I was struck by a very pronounced attitude of cynicism on the part of many Europeans regarding uniquely American ideals and principles, which were widely considered to be naive. To me, this film accurately captures this cultural and moral conflict, which lasted for decades and may even survive to this day. &quot;You and your American principles,&quot; they would often scoff at me with mocking derision. In many ways, the character of Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten), an American who crashes into post-World War II Europe, is a victim of a serious cultural divide. Unlike the Europeans, Martins always has the option of fleeing from the chaos and returning to the United States. For that alone, he may be resented by the local Viennese.\n\nWhat does Anna (Alida Valli) know about the illegal activities of her lover, Harry Lime (Orson Welles), which includes the sale of diluted penicillin to Vienna&apos;s hospitals? For children with meningitis, watered down penicillin was not only useless, but it created an immunity from full strength penicillin so that these afflicted children could never receive effective treatment. Corrupted penicillin is a glaring symbol of a totally corrupted Vienna. Harry surely understands the consequences of his business, but what about Anna? Even after the truth about Harry&apos;s conduct is clearly revealed to her, she still sticks by him to the bitter end. Love conquers all? Stand by your man, regardless of the misery that he is causing to his innocent victims? While I don&apos;t blame her for rejecting the romantic overtures of Martins, who is somewhat of a schnook, what&apos;s with her anyway? She reminds me of the Europeans who never once caught a whiff of the burning flesh from the overworked crematoria of the concentration camps that blackened the air all around them. She is deeply in love with Harry, so just shut up about children with meningitis. OK, Anna, whatever you say, sweetheart. Perhaps those silly 18th century costume comedies in which you appear will provide the escape from reality that you so desperately seek. At least you manage to crack a weak, forced smile on stage, which is the only smile that we will ever see from you.\n\nFrom beginning to end, the unusual camera angles, the dark, somber, haunting sidewalks of Vienna, and the conquered city&apos;s eerie, drenched cobblestone streets contribute to the overall foreboding atmosphere of the film, which was remarkably photographed by Australian Robert Krasker (&quot;Odd Man Out&quot;, &quot;Brief Encounter&quot;). From every direction and without advance notice, unforgettable images and characters appear before us, emphasizing an overall mood of mayhem and unpredictability. We witness, for example, Anna&apos;s landlady, draped in a bedspread for warmth in a state of deep distress by the sudden invasion of her house by &quot;officials&quot; representing not one foreign nation but four of them. Then we observe a ludicrous, bureaucratic &quot;cultural re-education conference&quot; offered to the Viennese by the allied victors, presumably to rehabilitate them after seven years of Nazi domination. And from where on earth did the balloon seller come as he pathetically peddles his merry merchandise on the dark, abandoned streets of Vienna, which are not only completely void of children at the time but of all people?\n\nAnd what of the inquisitive, confused character of Holly Martins, played with the usual, smooth agility of Joseph Cotten? As the writer of mass marketed western novels that even a young British sergeant happens to read, why is he broke, and what kind of job would Lime have offered him in an unfamiliar, German-speaking Vienna that is gripped by post-war disorder, unemployment, and foreign occupation? Construction work, perhaps?\n\nWhile some reviewers disliked the zither music of Anton Karas, I think that the unique, high pitched sound contributes to the general atmosphere of nervous tension and uneasiness that prevails. Would you prefer Strauss waltzes instead? They wouldn&apos;t be nearly as effective in conveying the overwhelming atmosphere of chaos, even insanity, that plagues Vienna on so many levels at the time.\n\nFinally, we are brought to the hidden network of grand Vienna&apos;s underground sewers. What could be a more fitting symbol of the underlying foulness that lurks beneath the thin, shallow surface of what we call &quot;civilization&quot;? This subterranean labyrinth provides the perfect setting for the ending of an extraordinary film that very effectively portrays a world that has succumbed to a state of disorder, misery, and even madness. Ultimately, it is all destined for the sewer. Bal-loon?",

      "reviewBody": "This is probably the best crime thriller I&apos;ve seen since &quot;Insomnia,&quot; and contains the most haunting climax of any serial killer flick since &quot;Seven.&quot; But like most films reaching for greatness, this is most admirable for its striking details.\n\nThe filmmakers here craft a taut, careful, and delicately strung together motion picture that relishes in its amazing development of mood, place, and character.\n\nFirst, the mood: Haunting cinematography (rain falling on a small village at night, shadows darting across a thick field of grass, figures lurking in the woods, a masterfully choreographed hot pursuit scene on foot), a poignant music score (aided by the creepy use of a Korean pop song that accompanies each murder), and no-nonsense direction (peppered with fabulous doses of comic relief--how Shakespearan!) keep the film more and more intriguing at each turn and fascinating to watch.\n\nSecond, the place: South Korea, circa the late 1980&apos;s, and apparently under some sort of militia rule. This is inspired by the true story of Korea&apos;s first publicized (and still unsolved) serial killer case. This unique time and place serves as a wonderful respite from the typical American big-city setting of so many other films of this ilk.\n\nFinally, the character development: The small details revealing the haunted souls of the detectives on the case is nothing short of brilliant. Witness the tiny executions of minutae: The cloth one rogue cop wraps around his boot so as not to leave scars when he kick-boxes suspects into submission, the harried chief of police checking his own blood pressure while trying to keep his off-the-cuff detectives in line or fighting to keep headline-starved reporters at bay, the young female officer desperately trying to showcase her abilities in crime solving between serving the chauvinistic detectives cups of fresh coffee, the outsider detective from Seoul&apos;s insistence that documents never lie (and the brutal irony at the climax that challenges his entire sense of being), and the main village detective&apos;s scathing speech on the difference between American FBI agents and Koren policemen. The beauty is in the details, and this film, like all the great ones, revels in their uncovering.\n\nOne flaw is that some might find the film a bit long in the tooth, but this is not to be missed for fans of serial killer thrillers and police procedural movies. For the Korean filmmakers, and the amazing cast...this is their master stroke.",

      "reviewBody": "This marks the fantastic return of the Wachowski brothers.Those who were disappointed with their last two efforts will not be disappointed here,there is no doubt that the Brothers are talented.Here they make their comeback.But not as filmmakers,but as producers and writers.And to be honest ,this film thrills you from beginning to end.You&apos;ll be blown away with this adrenaline excitement and dramatically intense thriller.\n\nA finely complex storyline about V, a reluctant freedom fighter , a rebellion who fights for freedom against the government in London in another time line.Set against the futuristic landscape of totalitarian Britain,a mild-mannered young woman named Evey who is rescued from a life-and-death situation by&quot;V.&quot; Incomparably charismatic and ferociously skilled in the art of combat and deception, V urges his fellow citizens to rise up against tyranny and oppression. As Evey uncovers the truth about V&apos;s mysterious background, she also discovers the truth about herself--and emerges as his unlikely ally in the culmination of his plot to bring freedom and justice back to a society fraught with cruelty and corruption.\n\nThis is perhaps the first and fully realized and most successful of all the Moore adaptations.What I liked about this film was the way it balances action and drama.The script is fantastic and directing is equally worth a mention.The assistant director on the Matrix(James McTeigue) movies really has some talent ,and handles the action and drama very well.The film is fast paced and exciting.It is also politically charged and quite controversial but that is the point.It makes you think about the current situation, how well is the government handling the situation of terrorism.V serves as an anti-hero on a quest of freedom.His actions are right but his methods are wrong,he is trying to bring about a message in the wrong way.\n\nThis film focuses on the source material of the book, more on the characters than on the action.More on the emotions and the drama than on the violence.This film doesn&apos;t glorify V as a terrorist but shows that under certain circumstances he was tempted to be what he is.The film has an intriguing atmosphere throughout,never once boring,an apocalyptic future setting really heightens the tension with starkly dark set designing and stunning cinematography.The action is striking and the performances in the drama are standout.This is a terrific movie at all points, it has a strong script , impressive directing and commendable performances.But having read the book after the movie,I must confess this film is still nowhere close to being better than the book.No way.It feels incomplete adaptation,leaving a lot of details behind,whereas the book had a more in depth look at V&apos;s life and his relationship with Evey.But I guess the filmmakers wanted to take a different approach,to which they succeed completely.\n\nThere is a reference or close resemblance to Guatanamo prison and 9/11 issues echoes throughout the film.And it made the film even more direct.There are several more references to our world dominated by politics and government,regarding terrorism.And what they do to secure their safety.This is one thing that makes V so controversial.His actions will make you think he&apos;s insane,but it&apos;s just an idea,a notion that alerts us to take actions if our own Government ever try to control us,and inflict fear into our lives. \n\nHidden behind the creepy mask ,Hugo Weaving really proves he is a versatile actor.His character provokes thoughtful questions in a dystopian future ,and every emotion of his character is brought out by Weavings performance.Portman on the other hand also excels,with a convincing accent.She really is the heroine of the film and she handles the role quite well.The scenes between Evey and V are touching and well handled.The rest of the film is superb in its execution.\n\nV is an idea,a symbol,a metaphor that cannot be destroyed.A man can be obliterated but as an idea,an icon he is indestructible and his message becomes more powerful to convey as people look upon this figure ,but not the man beneath it.One man can make a huge difference but united men and women can change something.And that&apos;s what made me respond to this film&apos;s ideas.It&apos;s full of it.Shed with technical and visual brilliance.\n\nA spellbinding adventure , exciting action, superb directing and writing and a Sci-Fi film with a thoughtful message,and the first fully satisfying Moore adaptation.This film is the most controversial and at the same time breathtaking Action/thriller.A terrific achievement produced by the Wachowskis&apos; and Silver.The climax,especially,was uplifting and beautifully executed.And will live on to be one of the most memorable conclusions.It always get me.\n\nIf there&apos;s anything out there in the theaters that will blow you away before summer season kicks off ,then this is a blast for you.",

      "reviewBody": "Blade Runner, directed by Ridley Scott and based on Philip K. Dick&apos;s novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, is a Sci-fi slash Noir film about a cop named Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) in a decrepit 2019 Los Angeles whose job it is to &quot;retire&quot; four genetically engineered syborgues, known as &quot;Replicants&quot;.  The four fugitives, Pris (Daryl Hannah), Zhora (Joanna Cassidy), Leon (Brion James), and their leader, Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), have escaped from an off-world colony in order to find their creator and bully him into expanding their pre-determined four year life span.  This film originally flopped when it came out in 1982, but since has become a widely acclaimed cult classic with a director&apos;s cut to boot.  A large part of the success that this movie has received can be attributed to its ability to operate on many different levels.\n\nRidley Scott&apos;s hauntingly possible depiction of what might become of Los Angeles down the line is absolutely brilliant.  It captures elements of Noir with its urban atmosphere of decadence, lighting, and characters neither clearly defined as good nor evil.  Corruption is everywhere.  The garbage-littered streets and permanence of dark and rain give us the sense that we&apos;ve seriously screwed up the atmosphere, and the impression that all respectable human beings have fled to the off-world colonies, leaving only the scum of the earth behind.\n\nThere is a hint of style from the 40&apos;s, especially with respect to cars, costumes, and music.  Rachael&apos;s entire outfit, including her hair, screams the 40&apos;s.\n\nThe soundtrack, arranged by Vangelis (who won an Oscar for his Chariots of Fire score), consisted mainly of Jazz and Blues.  This functioned to represent a dark, moody world of uncertainty and pessimism.\n\nThe special effects were exceptional.  Much of the set was pulled off using models.  In my opinion, sets made by hand require leagues more of skill and are much more impressive and realistic than those computer generated.  These guys really knew what they were doing.  I was especially fond of the pyramidesque Tyrell Corporation building, which hinted at the god-like presence of Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkell), the creator.\n\nThe script (Hampton Fancher, David Peoples, and of course Phil Dick) worked for me, as well as the actors who gave voice to it.  Harrison Ford was well...Harrison Ford.  I thought he did a tremendous job down-playing the role.  His voice-over narration helped you along, and was yet another feature conducive to Film Noir (apparently this was taken out of the Director&apos;s Cut).  Rutger Hauer&apos;s performance was intense.  His lines at the end were intriguingly philosophical.  Daryl Hannah&apos;s chilling robotic expressions were quite impressive.  Joanna Cassidy was just plain hot.\n\nThere is more to this film than just pulp.  It works on so many remarkable levels.  The movie itself is a detective noir quest for the meaning of life in a science fiction environment, but the story is a commentary on what it means to be human and the questions each one of us have about life, like: How long have I to live?  Why do I have to die?  What happens when I die? Doesn&apos;t my maker care?  Is this all merely an illusion?  At the end of the film we are left to wonder if these Replicants are human, and if Deckard himself is in fact a Replicant.  Scott raises more questions here than he answers, and as a result, critics are still debating the mysteries of this film today.  In a sense, the ambiguity of Blade Runner is the culprit of its success."

Thieves, drug addicts and a violent type of underclass live in doss houses with babies crawling round innocently unaware of the dangers they face.\n\nRenton (Ewan McGregor) is a heroin addict living day to day, stealing and looking for that hit. It is an empty life and he realises he needs to kick the habit but each time he tries to get off heroin something drags him back.\n\nRenton experiences the high side of heroin but he knows the low side is too high a price to pay. His friends and associates are making it difficult for him to stay clean.\n\nDirector Danny Boyle infused the film with a kinetic energy helped by its soundtrack. It is trippy, disjointed, hip even amoral in places. Despite its cool reputation it shows the ugliness of addiction. Especially with the character of Tommy who is a fitness fanatic and clean but turns to drugs when his girlfriend leaves him and he dies a horrible death.\n\nLike the movie A Clockwork Orange the film is driven by the narration of its central character which keeps the story together and brings out the dark humour.\n\nI only saw the film for the first time twenty years after its cinema release and was impressed how well it has stood up to the test of time.",

      "reviewBody": "With all the sorry films these days it is good to see a movie as funny, wicked, dramatic, and utterly demented as &quot;Fargo&quot;.  It&apos;s one of those films that you just have to see.  William H. Macy gives an Oscar-nominated performance as a car salesman who hires two thugs (one a know-it-all-know-nothing and the other a demented psychopath) to kidnap his wife so that he can keep half the ransom from her well-off father. Needless to say nothing goes right and Brainerd sheriff Frances McDormand (in an Oscar-winning role) comes in to save the day.  I won&apos;t give anything away because the material is too good to tell those who haven&apos;t seen this inventive film.  &quot;Fargo&quot; was ranked on the 100 Greatest Films list in 1996 and it was well-deserved.  In this age of by-the-numbers film making, this film was a refreshing flashback to the risk-taking style that made the 1970s such a great decade for movies.  5 stars out of 5."

Stunning set pieces and production design - such and effort was put into this. Fantastic cinematography, filled to the brim with pitch-perfect pans, wide-shots, and tracking-shots. Intense and dramatic score, deservedly receiving one of the total of seven Academy Awards. Brilliant cast and in particular Alec Guinness, who perfectly portrays a man of honour.\n\nWhat is a big shame is the way Colonel Philip Toosey - the original colonel, portrayed through Nicholson - was misrepresented, in that he actually acted very differently and much more courageously than in the film.\n\nNonetheless, as a look into the historic event that took place in 1943 Burma, it is absolutely brilliant, and although the film does not carry loads of emotional moments, it is technically excellent, and greatly entertaining.\n\nHighly recommended.",

      "reviewBody": "I have enjoyed most of the computer-animated films made so far, ranging from Pixar films like &quot;Toy Story&quot; and &quot;The Incredibles&quot; to DreamWorks films like &quot;Shrek.&quot; But &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; is the one that remains unparalleled, not because of its comedy or creativity, both of which are equaled in the &quot;Toy Story&quot; movies and in &quot;Monsters Inc.,&quot; but because it truly, more than any of the previous computer-animated features, reinvents the genre of the children&apos;s animated film.\n\nHumor in traditional animation is usually based on broad slapstick and physical exaggeration. There are occasional nods to this brand of humor in &quot;Finding Nemo,&quot; as when a flock of seagulls ram into a boat and we see their beaks crowing on the other side of the sail. But such sequences only call attention to how far this movie generally departs from old cartoon conventions. Instead, the movie invests its world of sentient animals with a surprisingly scientific texture. All of the animals are based on real species. The fish tank is constructed out of real devices. There is a strong sense of locale, as Marlin (Albert Brooks) travels across the Pacific to Australia, where even the animals speak with an Australian accent. In a scene that I&apos;m sure Gary Larson of &quot;Far Side&quot; fame loved, a pelican discusses with a group of fish the intricate details of dentistry. The fact that the animals talk and understand what&apos;s going on is treated as though it were a natural feature of the world. The realism is so striking that by the end of the film, you&apos;ll almost believe it possible for fish to plot an escape from a tank.\n\nFar from making the film pedantic, this approach results in an intelligent but still entertaining picture. Most of the humor is based on parodies of human behavior: repentant sharks start a club that&apos;s like Alcoholics Anonymous, a school of fish act like obnoxious DJs while forming themselves into spectacular patterns, and a four-year-old girl behaves like most kids that age, oblivious and destructive. The manner in which Marlin finds his way to his son is so inventive that we can forgive the film for the number of coincidences involved.\n\nThe story employs the same basic formula used in &quot;Toy Story,&quot; in which two characters, one uptight and the other clueless, are thrown together as they&apos;re forced to journey through a world populated by creatures that are a lot more knowing than the humans realize. This movie, however, creates a unique character in Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), a fish with short-term memory loss. To give a cartoon character a real human disorder is risky, to say the least, and I&apos;m glad the filmmakers didn&apos;t lose the nerve to include this ingenious device, which not only generates some of the film&apos;s biggest laughs, but reinforces the character interaction that is so central to the story. This is in fact the only Pixar film to feature true character development. In the course of his voyage, Marlin learns to be more adventurous, getting parenting tips from a surfer-dude turtle voiced by the film&apos;s director Andrew Stanton, while his son Nemo learns to be self-reliant.\n\nOf course, none of the sharks, jellyfish, whales, gulls, pelicans, lobsters, and humans that Marlin encounters along the way really mean any harm. They&apos;re just doing what they do. As Nigel the Pelican tells Nemo at one point, &quot;Fish gotta swim, birds gotta eat.&quot; That&apos;s perhaps the film&apos;s most interesting insight, that there are no true villains, just creatures that act according to their nature, and a few that transcend it.",

      "reviewBody": "Just saw Kill Bill: Vol. 1 and was surprised, to be honest, at how incredibly GOOD this film is. Here is a craftsman (or artist, if you prefer) at the top of his game. Some of the shots are simply incredible; the score is, for the most part, vintage Tarantino selections- and the RZA does a very good job at filling the blanks; Uma Thurman is a great female lead, for sheer presence (and decent acting chops). Even Lucy Liu, who I expected was going to re-hash her Charlie&apos;s Angel character, burst on the scene like a flaming nunchuck.\n\nThe stringing together of the scenes was impeccable. The transitions, the intercutting between dialogue, the flashbacks... I simply could not get enough. Tarantino IS, indeed, having fun here. He is giving us a film that may not go down as a classic, Pulp Fiction style, but that shows us what is yet to come. I doubt that he&apos;s lost his writing talents (as some have claimed), and I actually disagree that the dialogue in the film is &quot;poor&quot;, or that there are &quot;no memorable lines&quot; (Empire). The kung-fu genre has never been a particularly good park to display Shakespearean writing virtuosisms. The lines work fine. The plot is simple enough, but Tarantino takes a burger and serves it as &quot;steak tartare with sauce au poivre and asparagus terrine&quot;. He basically manages to cram so much information into the film that plot is simply irrelevent. What is relevent is the Bride&apos;s thirst for blood, her primal sense of vengeance and our total devotion to her. Bill, of course, is one of the greatest characters to ever NOT appear on screen. Overall, a great movie and an example of how a filmmaker&apos;s tool is not his pen: it&apos;s his eye.",

Lead by a great cast and great acting from its leads, this film is quite a step above simply a fighting film. There is more depth than expected as it has a great buildup to its characters- and they seem like real people rather than just one dimensional caricatures.\n\nWhat makes Warrior work is not only the acting but the drama is quite compelling, touching and emotional given. Very good writing. The backstory for both leads of Joel Edgerton and Tom Hardy are quite good and as the film goes, we see things unfolding for the best. Nick Nolte is also really well in his role.\n\nWarrior can be enjoyed by more than just fight fans as the story goes deeper them simply fighting. Although the film is quite long in runtime, the pacing gives the film enough where it moves very smoothly. Nothing feels quite out of order or seems to drag.\n\nThe ending was somewhat disappointing but it&apos;s understandable. Perhaps they could have went in another direction but other than that, Warrior is one of the better &quot;fighting&quot; &quot;sports&quot; films in recent memory.",

      "reviewBody": "An appreciation of this movie may demand some understanding of Japanese culture. The Japanese are rather reserved, and were even more reserved back in the early 1950&apos;s, when this film is set. No embracing, even of parents, children, siblings; no dramatic histrionics; even a death scene in this movie is much quieter than a Westerner might expect.\n\nConsequently I can&apos;t really blame several reviewers here for calling this movie boring and slow-paced. But it is not at all slow-paced from a different cultural perspective. It just depends on what you&apos;re used to.\n\nIf you do take the time to watch and try to understand it, you&apos;ll find an engrossing analysis of the dynamic of a middle-class family, the rift that grows up between generations, and of the many excuses we find ourselves making to justify our neglect for others, even those dearest to us. These themes are universal, but are couched in a postwar Japanese idiom, and so probably less accessible to the average Western viewer.\n\nI have wondered awhile about a speech at the end by Noriko, the widowed daughter-in-law, in which she denies that she&apos;s such a good person (though her actions in the movie indicate otherwise). I&apos;m still not sure I understand her motives in saying this. For the most part, however, this movie will not leave you puzzled, but it may leave you a bit wiser, and a bit more reluctant to make those excuses.",

      "reviewBody": "IMDb Top 250: 105\n\nI finished On the Waterfront about 2 hours ago, and something strange happened. Something I haven&apos;t done in a long while, I can&apos;t for certain remember the film that caused it. When the film ended, I sat in silence for about 10 minutes.\n\nOn the Waterfront is an inspiring film. There&apos;s a feeling you get watching it- movie magic. Something great is playing out in front of your eyes and you are taking in the collective effort of geniuses. Right from the start, with the dramatic score (that stays fine throughout) introducing the film, something special is happening.\n\nThe plot synopsis gives the appearance of a plain film, and plain it is not. The mob, murder and romance are the stars of this show and right off the start this is apparent- like the lighting of a fuse. Then as the wick burns down, the drama unfolds. We learn about Terry Malloy (Marlon Brando), his past and present, and his conflicted thoughts. We are introduced to characters that push him down the path he has to choose. A viewer grows to care about Terry, and until he decides for himself, we have no idea what he&apos;ll do.\n\nThis film is an acting gold magnet- it received 5 nominations in acting alone. I&apos;ll start with Brando&apos;s legendary performance. It doesn&apos;t matter what you think of him offscreen because for 2 hours he is at his very best, one of the best in acting ever. Terry is a fantastic character and Brando gives an unrivalled, honest performance.\n\nWanting him to stand against his negative influences are Father Barry (Karl Malden) and Edie (Eva Marie Saint). The father is a frustrated man, furious in his quest for righteousness. Only in The Exorcist have I liked a priest as much. He gives a raging performance, at its peak with a scolding of the longshoremen. Riveting. With him, but quite the opposite in character is Edie, who falls into the plot. Saint aces her characters role, which is to mold Terry. Their scenes are tender, believable, and in a recurring theme with the film, honest. During their bar scene I thought they could&apos;ve just made a romance together, leaving out all the drama.\n\nOn the other side, the mob union leaders, we have Johnny Friendly (Lee J. Cobb), the head honcho, who is ferocious, intimidating, and impeccably evil to honest workers. There&apos;s also Charley (Rod Steiger), Terry&apos;s older brother who is comfortably in with the mob. I didn&apos;t notice him at all, except for &apos;the scene&apos; which must&apos;ve made him in the Academy&apos;s eyes.\n\nSpeaking of &apos;the scene&apos;, the pivotal Taxi cab dialogue between Terry and Charley, you can tell as it happens this is the moment, the peak of On the Waterfront and Marlon Brando. It is the turning point of the film, where Terry makes some huge realizations that we can infer from only his face and tone. I won&apos;t even discuss his words, as it&apos;s been done by absolutely everyone. There are several other great scenes, like the &apos;It&apos;s a crucifixion&apos; speech and the various rooftop scenes.\n\nRight until the last scene we aren&apos;t sure what will happen. I won&apos;t spoil it, but it&apos;s elevating. Heroic. Even enlightening.\n\nOn the Waterfront is about the small speaking out against the large and corrupt. It&apos;s about going against the flow, breaking the silence. Sometime in your life you were or will be in Terry&apos;s position to some degree, and you&apos;ll either do or don&apos;t. Leave it at that, please don&apos;t read the director&apos;s reasoning behind the film. Take it for what it is: a fantastic film that will make you want to be a better person who can speak out against wrongdoers. Powerful indeed.\n\nI thought On the Waterfront would be good, but not this good. With stupendous performances, a top notch story and a strong message, On the Waterfront is film at it&apos;s best. 9.4/10",

I must admit that before watching this masterpiece I was a bit skeptical about it being a drama because most dramas I have seen evolve around irrelevant topics - but this movie will change the way you think.\n\nThe story is so heartwarming and real that it will move you far beyond anything you have probably ever experienced before. The actors do such an amazing job that you will sympathize with them and might indulge in some crying even if you are a male.\n\nEven if you don&apos;t cry this movie will touch you and will make you think about your own life.\n\nMovies that are able to and make you REFLECT and THINK about yourself, for my taste, are part of the best movies of all time because their messages are delivered in a way so that you will never forget them.\n\nGo see this movie and vote because this is not only the best Turkish movie ever, but one of the best movies ever made.",

      "reviewBody": "Prisoners is a gritty, incredibly well-acted, suspenseful, thought-provoking crime drama thriller. The film mainly focus on the choices taken and the consequences faced by the characters when worst things happen to them.\n\nIt simply raises the question: When your kid&apos;s life is at stake, how far are you willing to do to protect your family? It explores the likelihood of human behaviour when such crime is happening to us, blurring the lines between good and bad people.\n\nFor a 153 minute movie, the story does unfolds at a slow and solemn pace (which hurts the film and might bore some audiences) but the dramatic scenes performed by the main cast members in the film will keep you engaged. Hugh Jackman and Jack Gyllenhaal both giving intense, Oscar-worthy performances here, defining and developing their characters with various layers of emotions: affection, anger, grief, empathy, guilt...throughout the film.\n\nThe film&apos;s atmosphere, heavy rains, stormy days and icy cold winter managed to create a dark, dreadful environment to make up the dreary and haunting mood in the film. Every violent action taken by the characters are acts of desperation given that they are running out of time.\n\nHowever, the film is not perfect. Despite some plot problems from the various twists and turns shown in the film, the superb performances from the casts was sufficient enough to make the story succeed and believable.\n\nHighly recommended for those who wanted to watch a serious drama thriller with powerful, engaging acting performances from its talented casts.\n\nhttp://yjcool.blogspot.com/2013/09/movie-review-prisoners.html",

      "reviewBody": "Stalker (1979)***\u00bd Stalker is rich, spiritual and contemplative journey through the fantastic inner world of human&apos;s hope, desire, disillusions and believes. Main characters, Writer (as incarnation of irrational, imaginative and emotional aspects of our nature or subconsciousness) and Scientist (rational, logic forces or consciousness) are guided by Stalker (symbolizing our desire, will and everlasting search of meaning) to the mysterious Zone (which may represent all our spiritual goals, meanings, struggles to achieve them and barriers in our path). Breathtaking and mesmerizing images and sounds, witty dialog and strong concept are the major virtues of this feature. Writer&apos;s monologues are among the most meaningful, thought-provoking and spiritual moments I ever experienced in any art. But the movie is overlong losing its powerful initial momentum and becoming inconsistent in it&apos;s final message (by final I don&apos;t mean last in chronology but overall). Tarkovsky&apos;s earlier SF drama &quot;Solaris&quot; is more structured and fully developed. Nevertheless, Stalker is an outstanding piece of art movie that puts its director among the few true cinema masters. Rating: 8.5/10",

Murray Abraham, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, with terrific cameos by Bill Murray, Harvey Keitel, Edward Norton, Tilda Swinton, Jason Schwartzman, Tom Wilkinson, Owen Wilson, Jude Law and others I feel bad for forgetting here. \n\nWhile not Anderson&apos;s most profound film, it may be his most joyful. I don&apos;t think I stopped smiling from first frame to last, and I laughed out loud quite a few times. And yet, as in any good fable, there is some real poignancy as well. A top notch marriage of a lovingly crafted art-film and a wacky human comedy, something rarely pulled off with such panache. Even my friends who don&apos;t enjoy Anderson&apos;s work in general had nothing but good things to say. The sweetest treat of the movie year so far.",

      "name": "Overlong and not as deep as it thinks but still a very good film",
      "reviewBody": "Three steel workers from a small town in Pennsylvania prepare to go to war in Vietnam.  The night before they go, Steven is married, sparking a large celebration.  The next morning they go deer hunting one last time in the woods before they leave.  Time passes and the three meet up again in Vietnam as prisoners of war. Brutal mental torture affects them in different ways before they escape and are separated again.  Back in Pennsylvania Michael realises the extent to which the war has not only affected him but devastated the lives of his friends in different ways.\n\nI have seen this film several times and I&apos;ll admit that I always assume that it is a classic film mainly because I saw it twice when I was in my early teens and was blown away by parts of it.  I say this because I want to acknowledge that it may not be as great a film as many critics lists believe it to be, but at the same time I still watch it occasionally as I find it to be a moving story and a good film.  The plot is moving if it is viewed on it&apos;s surface as a tale of three men whose lives are deeply affected by the war.  Going past that to deeper themes I always feel that the film doesn&apos;t manage to be as deep as it thinks it is, so I try not to linger too long on these.\n\nThe breakdown of the film gives significantly more time to events in the home town rather than Vietnam.  This is as it should be \u0096 for many people the war was a fleeting thing that has stayed with them for much longer than they were actually involved.  The wedding scene is a little overlong but it does serve as a chance to get to see the characters in their setting before we quickly move to the events that changed them and the people they become. The time in Vietnam is quite short but very memorable (many people who have never seen the film will still know these scenes) and the final hour or so of the film is moving even if it takes things to an extreme to make it&apos;s point.\n\nThe cast make the film work as well, if not more, than the material itself. De Niro is the rock on which it all stands and is pretty good.  The only weakness in his performance was that he was the one who had to be `the hero&apos; type who does what he can.  Walken gets the lion share of praise for his is the role that changes the most significantly throughout the film.  It is easy to forget that he was not anywhere near as famous as De Niro at this time and it is amazing in that regard to see him hold his own.  Savage gives a good performance and support is strong in the form of such actors as Cazale, Dzundza and Aspegren.  Even Streep gives a performance refreshingly free of sentiment or forced accents.\n\nThe film is a little overlong and could easily have lost 30 minutes (although not all from one place) to give it a tighter feel.  Some scenes feel stretched beyond their useful duration leading to the feel that the film wanted to be 3 hours long, rather than being cut back to 3 hours long. Despite this though I still think this is a good film that is a powerful story at it&apos;s heart. I personally don&apos;t think it would make my top 50 (were I ever to do one) but I will watch it again."

      "reviewBody": "This film flopped when it was released in late 1926 for several reasons. First, its premiere was delayed because &quot;Flesh and the Devil&quot; was such a sensation that it was held over an extra couple of weeks. Second, people came to the movies to see Buster Keaton the comedian, not Buster the filmmaker and director, which is more of the role he played here. The film was funny, but it was not gag after gag, like so many of Keaton&apos;s other films. Keaton plays a railroad engineer living in the South. A title card declares he has two loves - his girl and his engine. when the Civil War starts he tries to enlist, but is considered too valuable to be in the Army due to his profession. His girlfriend misunderstands, thinks him a coward, and says she won&apos;t speak to him again until he is in uniform.\n\nMeanwhile, the Union forces have developed a plan to crush the South that involves stealing Buster&apos;s train. Unknown to Buster, his girlfriend is on the train at the time of the theft. Buster starts out in hot pursuit of the thieves to retrieve his train, still without the knowledge of his girl&apos;s captivity by the Union army.\n\nForgotten with the arrival of sound, the film revived - often cut up from its original length - in the 1950&apos;s because Buster didn&apos;t preserve his rights to the film and it fell into the public domain. That is the reason there are so many versions of The General out there today, often with poor video and hideous musical accompaniment.\n\nToday The General is considered one of the best silent feature length films, and one of the few silent films to not only be on DVD but to get the Blu Ray treatment too. SHERLOCK, JR. is clever. OUR HOSPITALITY is hilarious. The General is both of these things. It&apos;s story driven, races to a climax, and is fueled by cute, clever, inventive gags.Buster recycled these gags when he was a writer for MGM years later in &quot;A Southern Yankee&quot;.",

      "reviewBody": "This Keaton classic is both funny and extremely clever in its construction. Our hero is a cleaner but dreams of becoming a detective, always with his nose buried in a book on the subject.\n\nThe first third of the film is much like any other comedy. There are lost dollar bills, things sticking to other things, something stolen, mistaken identities. Our heroine is introduced in a charming scene where they seem terrified to hold hands. Her father is played by Buster&apos;s father Joe Keaton, who would appear in many of his son&apos;s films.\n\nThere&apos;s a mustachioed cad with slick hair and a sharp suit who is after the girl, a cartoon baddie who the audience instinctively knows deserves a hiss and not a cheer.\n\nIt is in Junior&apos;s other job as a cinema projectionist that the film comes alive. We are watching the film he has set up and then, suddenly, he is part of the action. In a sequence of great inventiveness, we see the film within a film changing scenes and watch with delight as the character adapts to each situation and surrounding.\n\nSherlock Jr is very funny but is also unusual and, in comparison with other comedies of the period, ahead of its time. It includes some excellent stunts that are the equal of anything done by Harold Lloyd in the same period, and, although it has a very short running time, manages to develop a good storyline throughout.\n\nJustly feted as a masterpiece of silent comedy, Sherlock Jr represented one of the peaks of Buster Keaton&apos;s cinematic career. It is a film worth watching and has stood up well today.",

Though Eastwood would rather focus on directing, he can still carry a movie with his on screen presence, and he&apos;s pure dynamite in &quot;Gran Torino&quot;. Perhaps the poor box office results of &quot;hollywoody&quot; movies like Absolute Power, True Crime, Space Cowboys, and Blood Work, caused Eastwood to shy away from acting, but given cutting edge material to work with as &quot;Million Dollar Baby&quot; and &quot;Gran Torino&quot;, he&apos;s as good as ever. His character as the racist and salty war vet makes you think of that old guy we&apos;ve all had on our blocks with the garbage door open, the million tools hanging everywhere, and always fixing or building something. I found myself not wanting the movie to end because the scenes between himself and the various Hmong characters where priceless. There may be complaints over the racist remarks and scenes, but Eastwood pulls it off in a way a real person like that would talk or act to a point where it ends up being lighthearted. I&apos;m not going to give the plot away, but if you like your Clint Eastwood as a hard-nosed tough guy with foul language alla Dirty Harry or Heartbreak Ridge, you&apos;ll love this movie!!",

      "reviewBody": "Ingmar Bergman&apos;s &apos;Persona (1966)&apos; opens with a bewildering montage of sounds and images, a frenzied newsreel of sex, death, cinema and comedy. The sequence is so far removed from my previous experience with the director that its effect is jarring, shocking; I momentarily wondered if I&apos;d hit a wrong button and started playing Bu\u00f1uel&apos;s &apos;Un chien andalou (1929)&apos; by mistake. I question Bergman&apos;s motives for including such an uncharacteristic opening, for it appears to have very little to do with the narrative that follows. Is this montage - an account of the sickening and concealed horrors and desires of society - a possible explanation for Elisabeth&apos;s continued silence? Even so, it all seems somewhat exploitative, as though Bergman was simply going for shock-value, obliterating any notions of subtlety with which I had begun to associate him {though I&apos;ll admit that the strength of &apos;The Seventh Seal (1957)&apos; arose from its not-so-subtle representation of Death}. The opening scene concludes with a young boy awakening in the morgue, his hand outstretched towards the vague image of a woman&apos;s face. Elisabeth&apos;s unloved child? Alma&apos;s aborted fetus?\n\nAn endless line of critics, it seems, have celebrated &apos;Persona&apos; as a masterpiece, and among the greatest films ever made. I&apos;d hate to be the lone voice of dissent, but the film is certainly the lesser of the three Bergmans I&apos;ve hitherto seen, if only due to the noticeable absence of the good-natured humour to be found in both &apos;The Seventh Seal (1957)&apos; and &apos;Wild Strawberries (1957)&apos;. If, indeed, I were to describe &apos;Persona&apos; as a masterpiece, it would be in regards to the visuals, which, photographed by long-time Bergman collaborator Sven Nykvist, are beyond description in their detail and intimacy. The film takes particular interest in the human face, and entire conversations of words and emotions are played out through the communication of the eyes, and the glimmering hint of a smile on the lips. There is one immortal moment in the film when Bergman juxtaposes the faces of each woman onto the screen, merging Elisabeth (Liv Ullmann) and Alma (Bibi Andersson) into a single entity.\n\nPersona also includes one of the most vivid depictions of sex that I&apos;ve ever seen. Though the film shows us nothing, Alma&apos;s whispered description of an intimate encounter on the beach is staggering in its effectiveness; her words allow the viewer to formulate their own visuals, every emotion and nuance perfectly incorporated from the rich story we are being told. Though I may exhaust hours spouting the merits of Ingmar Bergman&apos;s film, I can&apos;t escape the fact that watching &apos;Persona&apos; felt very much like a chore. The film boasts a relatively short running time, but it never seems to attain any comfortable sense of rhythm, and, by the film&apos;s end, I was left wondering just what the film was trying to get at. Bergman includes various allusions to Bertolt Brecht&apos;s &quot;Verfremdungseffekt&quot; effect \u0096 highlighting the inherent artificiality of the cinematic medium \u0096 with the film at one point appearing to burn; but, unlike in Fellini&apos;s &apos;8\u00bd (1963),&apos; these self-referential flourishes seem to serve little foreseeable purpose. Am I looking too far into this film for meaning? Or am I not looking far enough? Even just hours afterwards, another layer of meaning has unfurled itself. Maybe it&apos;ll get better.",

The beauty of this film is that the story is the most important element. The ending is both provocative and emotional - scenes of the night previously seen in darkness are now portrayed in lonely daylight as the sun rises and the story closes on these two characters.\n\nI saw this film by accident one night late on television. I have never forgotten it. So well is it made that the audience never question if this could ever really happen in life, reality being so absolutely characterised in it.\n\n&apos;Before Sunrise&apos; is simply the story of two strangers bound in Vienna&apos;s lonely night splendour - one night of love in all its glory, one superb piece of film making."

      "reviewBody": "In 1976, in Australia, the misfit and outcast eight-year old girl Mary Daisy Dinkle lives in Mount Waverley with her alcoholic shoplifter mother Vera Lorraine Dinkle that is addicted in Sherry and her absent father Noel Norman Dinkle that works in the Earl Grey Factory attaching strings in the teabag and spends his leisure time in his hobby - taxidermy. Mary has absolutely no friends and is teased by her schoolmate Benny Clifford. She has a complex because of her brown birthmark in the forehead and she adores her favorite cartoon The Noblets that she watches with her rooster Ethel and condensed milk. Meanwhile, in New York, the lonely forty-four year-old Max Jerry Horowitz has Asperge Syndrome and trouble to sleep and is obese since he eats chocolate hot-dogs to compensate his anxiety. He frequently goes to the Overeaters Anonymous Meeting. Max does not have any friend, only the invisible Mr. Ravioli, and also loves The Noblets. His life goals are to have a friend, Noblets and chocolate. One day, Mary picks Max address out of an American phone-book and she decides to write to him to ask from where babies come in America. Along their lives, they become pen pals and their unusual friendship oscillates due to the anxiety attacks of the unstable Max.\n\n&quot;Mary and Max&quot; is an unforgettable and heartbreaking bleak tale of friendship and loneliness. The story is bittersweet and witty, with an ironic black humor and provokes the most conflictive emotions in the viewers, funny in a moment, and depressive in the other. The excellent animation follows the dark style of Tim Burton and the screenplay is a profound insight in human behavior. My vote is nine.\n\nTitle (Brazil): &quot;Mary and Max \u2013 Uma Amizade Diferente&quot; (&quot;Mary and Max \u2013 A Different Friendship&quot;)",

      "reviewBody": "This was an entertaining and fun piece of film making from the ever-reliable Steven Spielberg. It is a bit of a depart from his usual full-blown and hugely epic pictures, yet this does not detract at all from the fascinating story of Frank Abagnale Jr. I was interested in this man before I&apos;d seen the movie, and it only served to increase my interest. Although it is important to remember (as with any such film) that this is only &apos;inspired&apos; by a true story and not told word for word from one, the plot is fascinating and keeps you laughing, crying and wondering until the end.\n\nFrank Abagnale Jr. is an astounding and interesting character. The real life Abagnale originally said that he did not believe Dicaprio to be &apos;suave&apos; enough to play the role, but he certainly does pull it off. Dicaprio&apos;s acting is superb, and totally believable as a man who could lie to, deceive, and con everyone he met without once losing any of his charisma or charm. Hanks is also excellent, he plays the role of the obsessed FBI agent well, and also with a likable quality. The interaction between these two characters was great, it was interesting to see a budding relationship slowly build between two characters who were actually positioned against one another.\n\nI loved the look of the film. It was a refreshing blast to see the 60s portrayed in such a vivid and colorful way. The whole setting and atmosphere of the film gave it a wonderful and almost (I hesitate to use the word) &apos;magical&apos; sense. This tone appealed to me much more than a darker tone might have.\n\nHowever, the film is rife with moral ambiguity. As much fun as it is to watch Dicaprio jumping from one place (and identity) to the next, forging checks and spending inordinate amounts of money at a whim, the film never really focuses on the morally bankrupt side of the story. The portion of the film devoted to this at the end still seems to skim over the fact that this man has stolen millions of dollars. It ends on a high note for Frank Abagnale Jr., never fully spelling out the wrongs he committed. Still, this would probably bring the whole film down, and sometimes it&apos;s fun just to enjoy a bit of escapism without being told off for desiring such things. I mean, it&apos;s hard to be totally strict and upright - you have to love it when Dicaprio&apos;s character swindles Jennifer Garner&apos;s prostitute for $400! \n\nOverall, this is a fun film and really enjoyable. Not as much of an epic masterpiece as some of Spielberg&apos;s other movies, but still a great film!",

      "reviewBody": "Frank Capra was an idealist for sure, but he certainly was clear-eyed in seeing some of the darkest problems with humanity and its institutions. At the beginning of this film, he shows us politicians who are firmly in the pocket of special interests, the degree to which is startling. A state governor (Guy Kibbee) is in charge of picking a new senator after one of the two serving for his state has passed away, but it&apos;s immediately clear that he operates as a puppet for a big businessman (Edward Arnold), a guy whose clout got the governor his position, and now who expects to call the shots as payback. We see it as one of the fundamental problems of representative government in 1939, just as it is today, so the film is highly, highly relevant.\n\nNow it&apos;s laughable that the governor would go rogue and put the head of the Boy Rangers, Jefferson Smith (Jimmy Stewart), in there instead, based on the pleading of his children and a coin flip that lands on its edge, but that&apos;s the premise of the film. It&apos;s an obvious call to clean up Washington, and get decent, upright people in there as representatives, and in delivering this message, Capra does not attempt subtlety or realism. And I may as well say it now before I blab on, it&apos;s laughable how the kids play the role they do later in the film too, and how the other senator (Claude Rains) behaves in the end. Maybe the film is pointing out that progress will always depend more on the next generation, and that ultimately it will require those in power to summon their sense of decency and stand up for what&apos;s right.\n\nOne thing I love is just how reverentially Smith treats the job he&apos;s about to undertake. First of all, he knows it&apos;s not about him. He&apos;s also not sure how well he&apos;ll do, but says &quot;I can promise you one thing: I&apos;ll do nothing to disgrace the office of United States Senator.&quot; After dropping off his crateful of pigeons (lol), we then see him wide-eyed as he tours the landmarks of Washington DC. The shot Capra gets of him beneath the giant statue of Lincoln perfectly captures his humility, and others the deep respect he has for the institution he&apos;s going to serve. We get a heavy dose of the ideals the country aspires to, with shots of Lincoln&apos;s second inaugural address (&quot;With malice toward none, with charity for all&quot;) and a recitation of a part of the Gettysburg address by a young boy, while his grandfather and an African-American man look on. It&apos;s quite flowery and may have the lip curling of every cynic who sees the film, thinking of all of the times America has done evil in the world, but just about to head into WWII was not one of those times, and regardless, I can&apos;t help but admire this scene. If only all of America&apos;s representatives went with a reverence for these ideals, respected the institutions from their hearts, and felt real humility and a need to not let down his or her constituents, or the leaders who came before them.\n\nEveryone else is aware of how the system in Washington actually works though, including the other senator (Rains), his handler (Eugene Pallette), and his secretary (Jean Arthur). Heck, even the young page who shows him to his seat is savvier. Smith says to the boy, &quot;I&apos;m just going to sit around and listen,&quot; meaning that he feels he has a lot to learn and shouldn&apos;t go in with guns blazing. The kid answers &quot;That&apos;s the way to get re-elected,&quot; reflecting how deep the cynicism of the process runs. Later it&apos;s parenthetically said that &quot;You can&apos;t count on people voting. Half the time they don&apos;t vote.&quot; These little bits are pointing out the same thing, that while we may decry the state of government, at the same time, to make it better we need to be active participants in it.\n\nStewart is fantastic in the film, with lots of memorable moments, such as when he nervously reads his proposal for a boys camp on the senate floor, and then later when his eyes are opened to deep corruption, which includes his father&apos;s friend and mentor, Rains&apos;s character. When he takes the Senate floor to filibuster and angrily yells &quot;No, sir, I will not yield!&quot; it&apos;s a fine, fiery moment, with palpable tension between the two men. I also love the softer scene with Arthur where he channels Walt Whitman in quoting his father, a man who died fighting for the little guy and the free press: &quot;My dad had the right idea. He had it all worked out. He said: &apos;Son, don&apos;t miss the wonders that surround you. Every tree, every rock, every anthill, every star is filled with the wonders of nature.&apos; He said, &apos;Have you ever noticed how grateful you are to see daylight after coming through a long dark tunnel? Well,&apos; he said, &apos;always try to see life as if you&apos;d just come out of a tunnel.&apos;&quot;\n\nArthur turns in a solid performance with her character, who is also inspiring. She knows how congress operates, giving Stewart (and the viewer) a little tutorial, and then coaching him from the balcony. We see that her character is jaded, but that there is still a glimmer of idealism in her, and also a healthy amount of disgust for politics. &quot;You&apos;re half-way decent, you don&apos;t belong here,&quot; she tells Stewart. We see both of these characters go through the inevitable response to the ugliness of politics - considering leaving the aggravation and frustration of it all, because it&apos;s the fight of an underdog to try to change it, or to stay and fight, because that&apos;s the only way anything will ever change, and what great leaders have had to do too as well. As this is a Capra film, you can guess which one of these paths they take.\n\nIt&apos;s certainly an arduous path, as the political boss is incredibly powerful. There is real evil, greed, and corruption here, and Arnold plays his part perfectly. The scene where he tries to get Smith to play ball is reminiscent of Potter calling George Bailey into his office in &apos;It&apos;s a Wonderful Life,&apos; and has a similar outcome. When Smith stands up in revulsion, the boss immediately turns to Plan B, which is crush him. He does what corrupt and deceitful people in politics have always done - he drums up charges of the very same things he is guilty of against those who oppose them. He also uses his power over the press to wage a misinformation and propaganda war. Maybe you&apos;ll recognize these patterns from the present day.\n\nThe ending is a little messy, and I would have liked it more had Smith somehow been shown swaying the other senators with arguments and reason. How does one reach across the aisle and bridge such a gap of disagreement and entrenched special interests? However, I have to give the film credit for shining a light on corruption in politics, and I loved how its truthful message was so powerful that many offended politicians branded the film as communist propaganda. As Smith says, what&apos;s needed in politics is &quot;plain, ordinary, everyday kindness. And a little looking out for the other fellow too.&quot; Indeed.",

      "reviewBody": "In fact it&apos;s one of Kubrick&apos;s most gripping pictures, with a narrative drive second only to that of &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; (and it&apos;s unquestionably a more glorious creation than, say, anything he made in the 1950s).  English director Michael Powell (while attributing a similar failing to one of his own works) says that Kubrick fell into &quot;the trap of the picturesque&quot;, but while I admire Powell as a creator, the judgment is absurd: at the VERY least, each lush image shows us people not just occupying a part of the screen but inhabiting a world, and tells us much about their relation to that world.  Many shots are indeed amazing and beguile the eye, but they don&apos;t have the effect they do simply because they would make nice postcards.\n\nTHIS, I feel sure (without having read Thackeray), is the proper way to adapt a long story from novel to screen.  Each scene is either allowed as much time as it needs to make its point and its impact, or it&apos;s cut altogether - you won&apos;t catch Kubrick skating too quickly over his material for no better reason than to fit it all in.  The third-person narration (consisting of witty, beautifully crafted sentences - it&apos;s about time I did read Thackeray) almost performs a kind of dance with the images, gliding in just when we need it, taking a step back when we don&apos;t.  (So rarely is even third-person narration used so well.)  And as always, Kubrick&apos;s musical sense is unerring.  My impression at the time was that I was listening to mid-eighteenth century music that gave way to pieces from the classical era as the hero started to move in higher and higher circles.  I was more or less right.  But then I noticed Schubert&apos;s name in the credits - and I realised with a start that I&apos;d been listening to, had even started tapping my feet to, a Schubert piece I was familiar with, without the anachronism registering.\n\nIt&apos;s a pity Kubrick stopped making epics after this.  Look at the ones he&apos;s responsible for: &quot;Spartacus&quot; (not a project Kubrick was fond of, admittedly, but still the most magnificent of all Roman epics) &quot;2001&quot; (the most magnificent of ALL epics), and &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;.  The last of the three is by no means a poor cousin.",

At that time, a pacifist politician-doctor-athlete arrives to deliver a speech about disarmament. This does not please the military, who devise a plot to do away with him. The politician is killed and his murder is covered up as an accident. The rest of the film is about the efforts of the Examining Magistrate and a newspaper photographer to uncover the truth.\n\nFor those who are up to date with Greek history, the country is Greece, the city is Thessaloniki and the politician is Grigoris Lambrakis. But that is of small importance, since this is a story which could have (and possibly has) happened anywhere at any time in history.\n\nAbout the film: the cinematography is excellent, even by today&apos;s standards. The acting and direction are both top class. But what impressed me the most was the film&apos;s editing. After the slow first 15-20 minutes or so, the film picks up a pace which is tight and lightning fast. The dialogue is concise and to the point - the film&apos;s last lines, spoken by the Narrator and found in the quotes section of IMDb, never fail to bring tears to my eyes. Finally, the film offers what I consider to be the best film score of all time (but I may be a bit biased on this, since the score is by Mikis Theodorakis, my personal favourite).\n\nThis kind of documentary-style film making has been done plenty of times since, especially in political thrillers. But this is what sparked everything up. Watch this film. You&apos;ll be rewarded.\n\nMy rating: 10/10",

      "name": "one of the most violent sensory assaults that can be experienced in a cinema",
      "reviewBody": "Good war-films can be very disturbing to watch. The dramatic realism of modern digital effects spares little and many audiences will find Hacksaw Ridge (2016) one of the most violent sensory assaults that can be experienced in a cinema. If it were not a true story that celebrates an unusual hero the film could have been accused of a gratuitous display of unrelenting carnage and military triumphalism.\n\nThe film plays in two halves: the early life and romance of Army Medic Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) and the actual Battle of Hacksaw Ridge. Raised in bible best Virginia, Doss had a troubled upbringing under an abusive father. A devout Seventh-day Adventist, he swore never to commit violence or even carry a weapon but felt duty-bound to enlist in the Army. Not long after meeting the one love of his life, nurse Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer), he enlisted with the belief that he could serve his God unarmed and without killing enemy soldiers.\n\nBranded a coward and bullied to leave, he was eventually granted conscientious objector status and became one of the troops sent to capture Hacksaw Ridge in the Battle of Okinawa of May 1945. While the assault was forced to retreat under overwhelming enemy fire, Doss remained behind and single-handedly evacuated 75 casualties, lowering them by rope from an escarpment over 100 metres high. The Ridge was eventually captured and Doss became one of the most decorated heroes of World War II.\n\nThe heroism depicted in this story is of such an extraordinary magnitude that it can easily overwhelm any consideration of the film&apos;s merits. With an uncomplicated and factual narrative arc, the story rests on two pillars: acting and filming. On both scores, this film deserves high praise. While the early life and romance chapter drifts towards melodrama, Garfield is cast to perfection as the wide-eyed and straight talking man of unshakeable principle and Palmer convincingly plays his adorable emotional anchor. Together with a strong support cast that includes several big-name stars, this is a powerful ensemble that carries the story convincingly.\n\nThe most outstanding element of this film, however, is its powerhouse hyper-realistic cinematography and spectacular set constructions that relentlessly convey the brutality of war. While it is an outstanding technical production, giving spectacle precedence over narrative is the film&apos;s Achilles Heel. One or maybe a few helmeted heads shredded or bodies bayonetted can convey much, but twenty deadens the senses. If ever there was a case where less could have been more, this is it. Otherwise this is a gripping film with forceful storytelling about a remarkable war hero.",

He was the only American soldier in WWII to fight on the front lines without a weapon, as he believed that while the war was justified, killing was nevertheless wrong. As an army medic, he single-handedly evacuated the wounded from behind enemy lines, braved fire while tending to soldiers and was wounded by a grenade and hit by snipers. Doss was the first conscientious objector awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor."

      "reviewBody": "Wow, actually a thriller that&apos;s pretty good. Yes, it&apos;s fair to say that &apos;Gone Girl&apos; is a really engrossing film. As with almost every film, it&apos;s based on a book. And, as with most films based on a book, I haven&apos;t read the book, so I haven&apos;t got a clue how well the film relates to the source material. But then I don&apos;t care. I just enjoyed the ride.\n\n&apos;Gone Girl&apos; is one of those films where you don&apos;t want to say too much about for fear of giving things away and spoiling it for people who haven&apos;t seen it. Ben Affleck plays a (reasonably) decent husband whose well-to-do wife disappears. The media circus that follows then starts to reveal that the truth is far more complicated that it first seems (not to mention the obligatory police investigation). It&apos;s fair to say that what follows is a film that twists and turns, so you only really get one chance to watch it and not know what&apos;s coming.\n\nMany people don&apos;t really like Affleck when it comes to acting (even less now he&apos;s due to don the Batsuit!), but I think most people will relate to him as he gets pursued and hounded (unfairly? You&apos;ll have to wait and see!) by the media. Rosamund Pike plays his (gone!) wife with a flawless American accent. Again, you&apos;ll have to see whether she&apos;s found alive or dead. The story bounces around back and forth in time, making sure you&apos;re just confused enough never to put too much together before the film&apos;s ready to reveal what&apos;s happening.\n\nIf I had one complaint it&apos;s that the film is a little too long. Perhaps ten to fifteen minutes could have been edited out at around the three quarters mark, just to speed it up. But that&apos;s a minor gripe. Basically, if you like your thrillers twisty and turny (and have a couple of hours to spare on a film that you really have to concentrate on) give this one a go.",

Make no mistake, despite short bursts of touching serenity, this films starts up full throttle and doesn&apos;t let-up. I can only assume reviewers here scoring this film 8 or less must be Vulcan by birth, or just terminally insensitive. This is a first rate drama with stand out performances all round.

Dryer. However, Renee Maria Falconetti is the reason this film indeed surpasses all attempts at reaching the Platonic form of brilliance. Her performance is breathtaking by all accounts. One can not help but remain mesmerized by her expressions. Yes Dryer&apos;s gift to us of so many wonderful close shots of Falconetti should be acknowledged. He must be praised for his relentless filming of scenes to produce the desired result. Yet to imagine anyone else in this timeless role (such as Lillian Gish who was said to have been considered) is to envision a less than perfect film. Unimpeded by the silent medium in which she worked, Falconetti&apos;s mere tilt of the head or gentle glance pierce the soul of the viewer. We see her speak in Jeanne&apos;s native tongue. We see her compelling portrayal of the anguish which the saint most certainly endured. It is almost as if we are watching what the director said he had found; the martyr&apos;s reincarnation! This actress presents to us her raw beauty unmarred by powders or makeup - thanks to a decision of Dryer. How bitter-sweet the fact that we have this once thought to be lost silent film and yet can not help now but to long for more Falconetti. And so we return to &apos;La Passion de Jeanne d&apos;Arc&apos; and with each of many tears and inaudible sighs marvel at the staggering accomplishment which is Renee Maria Falconetti&apos;s Jeanne.",

      "reviewBody": "I&apos;m just going to get down to my point: Twelve Years A Slave is a good film. It may be an even better film to people who know less about slavery, however, to me it is just &quot;A little better than good&quot;.\n\nTwelve Years A Slave tries really hard to make the audience uncomfortable by showing the truths of slavery and the cruel world slaves lived in during the middle of the 19th century... and it succeeds at it. The movie doesn&apos;t hide how messed up some of the slave masters were and how delusional others were. I have read a bit of the book along with the autobiography of Frederick Douglass and several other slaves. The movie does interpret these events very well.\n\nHowever, this is where the movie&apos;s fault comes in: The movie isn&apos;t much more than a slave statement. Slavery is bad. Here is a man who changed and went through much suffering. While I condemn racism and I&apos;m glad this movie shows the wrongs of the past, the movie doesn&apos;t do anything more than show a whole bunch of wrong doings. The movie is just: bad event, bad event, bad event, bad event--coincidentally similar to Gravity in a sense. The movie doesn&apos;t stand up and prove anything that the audience (maybe it&apos;s just me) didn&apos;t know. We have seen slavery movies in the past and we have read the autobiographies. The movie forgets to be something more than an anti-slavery statement. Slavery has already been gone in America for over 150 years, so the movie needed something more to its message other than &quot;slavery is bad&quot;. \n\nGranted, racism is still an issue today, which is why this movie still holds importance. Still, the movie doesn&apos;t try to do anything other than inform of the evils of the past. The movie is literally a series of horrible things and that is it. As soon as the evils end, the movie ends. In my opinion, the movie needed to flesh out its purpose a little more.\n\nOn a side-note: This movie has one of the most generic soundtracks I have ever heard, and it is even down-right bad at times. Not even joking, you will hear the same chords played exactly the same for the entire movie.\n\nA good movie, but it doesn&apos;t bring anything new to the table regarding the issues of America&apos;s past.",

Whether intentionally or not, the film implies that Hitler himself was a Hitler-impersonator, that Hitler is a kind of unattainable ideal, a Platonic idea of pure evil. A similarly sublime and bold and touching film made during another craziness (not twenty years thereafter, as its more applauded cousins!) is &quot;THE GAY DECEIVERS&quot; (1969). It too dances with the gods, and breaks your heart as it makes you laugh."

You feel it in the sing-songy banalities of Fargo, and in the noiresque machine-gun dialogue of Miller&apos;s Crossing, but neither of these can prepare you for the feast for the ears that is The Big Lebowski.\n\nChanneling the opaque mysteries of Raymond Chandler, the Coens throw LA resident bum and Bowling aficionado Jeff Lebowski (&quot;The Dude&quot; to his friends) into a strange triple-crossing case of kidnapping, ransoms, nihilists and urinated-upon rugs. It is the equivalent of throwing unrelenting forces at an immovable object, the Dude&apos;s bemused stoicism at constant odds with the world around him. He&apos;d much rather be bowling with crazed Vietnam Vet Walter (John Goodman) and pure silent soul Donnie (Steve Buscemi).\n\nAs with so much of the Coens&apos; output, style is more than half the point: not just visual, though ace DP Roger Deakins paints an alluring canvas, but tonal and auditory. This is an insanely funny head-trip of a movie, with wonderfully idiosyncratic characters, down to the smallest part. Who better than the Coens to reinvent the comedy of errors?\n\nThis is without a doubt one of their very best, a personal favorite, an unmissable film and the kind of experience that will plant an indelible smile on your face. Do yourself and see this now, if you haven&apos;t already.",

I suppose if you were in High School sometime between 1990-2008, one of your teachers thought I&apos;d be a good idea to watch this movie and I still remember my reaction and the ones of our fellow classmates: Yeah, probably a boring movie that will try to make the school look better and encourage us to do our homework and study for our tests. I couldn&apos;t have been more wrong. This movie definitely changed my way of thinking to a certain extent and there are very few films who have moved and touched me like this one.\n\nThe movie plays in 1959 and centers around a private academy somewhere in New England. The curriculum is extremely difficult and the teachers have no humor and are very strict. The new English teacher though, Mr John Keating (Robin Williams), who graduated from the very same school, uses unorthodox, but quite effective methods to teach the students about literature, and poetry. During their first lesson, he tells them that they can either call him Mr. Keating or &quot;Oh Captain, my Captain&quot;, based on a quote by Walt Whitman. He encourages them to come out of themselves, use their energy to make their lives worth living and beautiful - Carpe Diem, Seize the Day! The plot also centers around two students: Neil (Robert Sean Leonard), who is funny and popular, but fails to gain his fathers pride, because of his wish to become an actor, and Todd (Ethan Hawke), who is very shy and unsure of himself, and is inspired by Keating to use his imagination and eventually we find out that he is very talented when it comes to poetry. After they find out about a club Keating was a member of while he was a student, the Dead Poets Society, which was forbidden by the school, they decide to reestablish it, what ultimately gets them into a lot of trouble.\n\nThere are several key factors, that make this movie as brilliant as it is. First of all there is the acting. Robin Williams, who I really like as a Comedian, really proves that he is a great actor, who can get deep into a character and play him with such passion and energy that you will forget he&apos;s an actor. Keating, whose teaching methods are indeed unusual and will probably make you laugh a couple of times, is a very interesting role, the teacher we all would have wanted, but not because he doesn&apos;t give homework or makes up very easy, open-book tests. No, because Keating shows us that we have to come out of ourselves, make the best of our lives and especially that there is a poet in everyone of us. Then there is the terribly under-appreciated Robert Sean Leonard, who also gives a very moving performance as a student, who is kept back by his father, and therefore fails to make his dreams come true. In my opinion he is very underused as an actor, and should have gotten a lot more leading roles. As for Ethan Hawke, he definitely was the best choice for the character he plays. We can literally feel his fear and shyness when he stands in front of the class and gets no word out, because he&apos;s so embarrassed.\n\nPeter Weir, who is probably most known for his recent movie &quot;Master and Commander&quot; shows what a great director he is with this film and it definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, and the nominations for Best Picture, Director and Leading Actor for Robin Williams.\n\nSome of you may have heard about Roger Ebert absolutely negative review of this movie and that &quot;he wanted to throw up at the end of the film&quot;. I can understand why people might not like the ending (I won&apos;t put any spoilers), but I think it just adds to the the beauty and drama of this film, a film that should definitely be on the IMDb Top 250 Movies. This is a movie, you must have seen!!",

      "reviewBody": "I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter books, they&apos;re all so great and magical. But I didn&apos;t think the film series were perfect at all, but they were still great movies. With that, I was extremely excited to see the end of the film franchise, and impressed with the trailers. So I had high expectations. And thankfully it did not disappoint, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II, blew past my already high expectations and I was enthralled!\n\nThe whole movie looked spectacular! The cinematography extremely well done, the art direction was incredible. The movie was beautiful to look at, the visuals were spectacular and truly Oscar worthy! The set designers, cinematographers really need to be awarded for their work, because it looks like they spend of time and money on the look of the film. \n\nThe cast of the film was pretty much perfect, they should all be applauded too. Emma Watson, as usual is and great and she&apos;ll have a bright career ahead of her. Rupert Grint is pretty much great also, he is a fine actor indeed. Daniel Radcliffe did an amazing job and was very memorable as Harry Potter. Although I think Ralph Fiennes was the star of the film, he did unbelievable job as the evil, crazy Lord Voldemort, I think he deserves an Oscar Nomination for his role. The rest of the cast were also great too.\n\nWe all grew up overtime with the series, we followed the adventures of Harry Potter for around 10 years, I think. It seems very weird that there will be no more Harry Potter films to look forward too. I will miss the franchise very much! However I am happy the series got an amazing ending. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II is not only the best film in the series, but it will probably be one of the best films of 2011. Everyone should see this film, even if they don&apos;t like past Harry Potter films.",

      "reviewBody": "In the ears and minds of any movie lover, the word &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; resonates like the quintessential Hollywood classic oozing respectability in every inch of celluloid but the same respect we owe to an old relic. In our cynical modern world, who would enjoy a pompous-looking big-budget swords-and-sandals religious epic when you have Tarantino and Appatow?\n\nI saw &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; for the first time in fourth grade, it was part of our history course and being an Asterix buff, I loved watching real-life legionaries, galley slavery not to mention the chariot race, the film also enlightened me on Christianity and on Judaism (when my only religious reference was monotheism number three) and scared the hell out of me with leper. It worked on a cinematic level as much as educational, I guess even in its TV-sized crappy 80&apos;s VHS look, we kids enjoyed &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; especially the rivalry between Judah (Charlton Heston) and Messala (Stephen Boyd).\n\nI never watched &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; after that but nor did I have any doubt over its status as a colossal masterpiece. Watching it again a few years ago and then a few days ago, I was surprised by how engraved in my memory &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; was, and how the moments that stood out were still having the same effect. When Ben-Hur and Messala meet after many years, I&apos;m always anticipating that first breech in the fortress of their friendship when the young Roman tribune will have one word too many about Ben-Hur&apos;s people, taking for granted their friendship and Judah&apos;s nobility as marks of submission. The second encounter is even more thrilling because it&apos;s like watching a shaking edifice waiting to collapse.\n\nIt was a nice call from the director Wyler to mark the feud between the two ex-friends at the second encounter, hence putting more gravitas around their relationship, that screenwriter Gore Vidal tried to impregnate with homoerotic subtext. The story is known by movie buffs, Vidal wanted to make the interactions look as the two rivals were former lovers, the subtext works even more when you look at Stephen Boyd&apos;s &quot;enamored&quot; eyes toward Charlton Heston. But &apos;Chuck&apos; never knew the trick and was annoyed about it, I guess I prefer the way their hatred epitomize the conflict between Romans and Jews sealing as one of the most memorable rivalries in history of cinema, with the most heart-pounding climactic face-to-face (or should I say wheel-to-wheel).\n\nI had positive feelings about &quot;Gladiator&quot; but &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; is the masterpiece that dwarfs any contemporary masterpiece, a sweeping revenge story that doesn&apos;t rely at all on fake CGI and special effects. It took William Wyler&apos;s expertise built up in three decades of experience to make &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; equal the reference of the time that was Cecil B. De Mille&apos;s 1925 version. As a matter of fact, &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; has been blockbuster material from the start, ever since Lewis Wallace&apos;s best-seller of the late century, it was played on theaters and not with modest budgets. A revenge story, with galley combats, a chariot race and an oblique take on the greatest story ever told, with a hero going from idealism to anger, from revenge to love, all wrapped up in a subtle religious conversion, &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; was an instant classic Hollywood couldn&apos;t ignore.\n\nIf 1925 had the race and the thrills, the 1959 one had a bigger scope, bigger budget, the colors, the talking and all the determination of a big studio like MGM to prove a 50&apos;s audience that TV wasn&apos;t yet the pinnacle of spectacular entertainmnet. When I hear my Dad talking about going to the movies, like &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, &quot;Spartacus&quot;, &quot;Guns of Navarone&quot; or &quot;Taras Boulba&quot; you would think he went there, inside the screen. And right now, I can&apos;t imagine the eyes of people staring at the screen during the chariot race, there comes a moment where you stop watching the moment as a plot element, but as a real race, and it never, never suspends your disbelief, it&apos;s like at any new viewing, Messalah can finally win.\n\nThere are so many classic moments that filled the three-hour-and-half journey that you&apos;re never in a state of non-anticipation, when the new inquisitor&apos;s parade starts, you keep an eye on that loose roof tile, the one that started the whole chain of events. In the desert, you wait for the &apos;greatest cameo ever made&apos;, in the galleys, the big fight and Ben-Hur rescuing Arrius (Jack Hawkins) and it goes on and on. I must reckon after the chariot race, the film gets a tad too long, but only because you can&apos;t just sweep off such a rich epic with a five-minute resolution, and Charlton Heston, in his greatest role, contributed a lot to the everlasting appeal of the film, I don&apos;t think he gets the credit he deserved, he brings to his Judah Ben-Hur a dimension of emotional vulnerability that could have been laughable from a lesser actor.\n\nOther cast members include Oscar-winning Hugh Griffin enjoying his role as Arab sheikh and Judah&apos;s mentor, Israeli actress Haya Harareet as Esther, Martha Scott and Cathy O&apos;Donnell as Judah&apos;s mother and sister... the film is served by a solid cast, editing, directing, having swept off all the major Oscar by breaking the record of 11 wins, only to be matched in 1997 with &quot;Titanic&quot; and &quot;The Return of the King&quot; and oddly enough, these titles could somewhat apply to &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;. \n\nI haven&apos;t seen the &apos;original&apos; and I&apos;m in no hurry for the remake, but I don&apos;t get I&apos;ll be in a minority if I say that this is the ultimate version. I didn&apos;t see it many times in my life but it&apos;s always present in my memories as if it wasn&apos;t about the number of times you watch it but the intensity of each experience. And let&apos;s not forget the name of the director: William Wyler who outdid himself by making his masterpiece, which is saying a lot, given his previous streaks.\n\n&quot;Ben-Hur&quot;: A Christ Tale, a tale of vengeance, in fact a tale of all tales...",

      "reviewBody": "Mad Max Fury Road follows a determined man named Max Rockatansky to wander the post-apocalyptic wasteland alone, Max surely joins Furiosa, a fugitive imperator, and her band who are all trying to escape a savage warlord and are trying to get to a safe haven. I really can&apos;t describe how in awe I was with this film, I was extremely impressed. The stunts, the makeup, the action &amp; the camera shots were all so dead-on and did not fail to impress. One thing that kinda upsets me is that when the film ended and everyone was walking out, I overheard things like &quot;that was garbage&quot; or &quot;what a piece of sh*t film&quot;, that really angered me a little because I know that a lot was put into this film and they think they can do better? Unbelievable. Anyway, this didn&apos;t dissatisfy me at all and let&apos;s talk about why it did! Even though this is supposed to be a action film, they added some slow moments just to emphasize more character and fondness toward each person which was fantastic. George Miller did such a satisfactory job with that. The action, don&apos;t let me forget about the action, this is what made the film so much more engaging to watch and I mean that with each insane character given, it made the action more fun and insane to watch. The score was unbelievable, I&apos;ll just leave it at that because you know, it was! Tom Hardy had some pretty big shoes to fill but yet he knocked it right out of the park with given so little dialogue to say, he still manages to be a complete badass. Same goes for Charlize Theron, she played such a cool character with some great sympathy for herself and the people shes protecting and yet she does have some sweet skills and the prosthetic arm was a nice touch. Also for Nicholas Hoult, he plays such a basket case that will do anything to impress Immortan Joe and yet, he starts to become a very likable character. I swear, the makeup in this was was so spot-on that I really believed that these were actually mental people and also I thought that half of the people in this looked like albinos which added more effect to the mental aspect of them. The camera angles in this were flawless it was unbelievable even with so much going on at the same time, George really managed to get a lot of what we had to see, wait, I mean we needed to see! Hugh Keays- Byrne did such a menacing job as Immortan Joe, he played the role as such a character that doesn&apos;t let anything get in his way and always gets what he wants but yet so insane. Yes, there was a lot of disturbing images in this that can probably make you gag a little, it&apos;s truly a sight for sore eyes of what I had to see in this but hey, we&apos;re talking about a Mad Max film here. The costume design was very odd as well which looked so deserted and worn that them fit so well each character. My favorite part of the film would have to be the beginning scene, George proved he really knows how to work a camera and really made the atmosphere of the situation Max was faced with, more exciting and intoxicating! Overall, I might of exaggerated in this review but who cares, it was worth it and I mean&apos;t every word of it and this film might possibly be a modern day masterpiece! With a 2 hour runtime, this film really seems to go by fast but yet who&apos;s worried about that when you&apos;re distracted by such insanity. Please guys, go see this action packed, pulse pounding &amp; off the wall thrill ride to Fury Road with the Mad Man himself!"

      "reviewBody": "Generally, either &quot;Seventh Seal&quot; or &quot;Persona&quot; is the film that a critic will name if s/he is stuck with the task of naming Ingmar Bergman&apos;s greatest achievement.  A couple others might be named, but rarely do you hear a critic espouse the brilliance of &quot;Autumn Sonata.&quot;\n\nThe first thing I noticed about this film is that it is, like &quot;Cries and Whispers,&quot; nothing less than a painting.  The textures, the warm reds and the close-ups of the faces of wounded souls, all combine to make the viewer realize that s/he is witnessing High Art.\n\nThen there&apos;s the shot of  Liv Ullman&apos;s wounded profile as she stares at her mother, Ingrid Bergman, while mother shows Liv how the Chopin piece should be played.  It is an eloquent scene.  Truly heartbreaking and unforgettable. One can feel Liv&apos;s pain begin to show itself: it is the painful shame of inadequacy and mediocrity made all the more shameful because it is mother inspiring these feelings in her.\n\nLater, it&apos;s Liv&apos;s cruelty toward her mother in that unforgettable late night diatribe.\n\nAnd finally, it&apos;s Liv&apos;s crippled sister and Ingrid&apos;s disgust at the thought that not only did mediocrity crawl out of her womb, but so did deformity and suffering.\n\nThe film is bleak (obviously) and the resolution is only slightly hopeful. It is however a masterpiece -- a film that reveals that what the world needs now is not Love, as the song proclaims, but Compassion and Grace.  Liv Ullman is the only actress who can say these things without opening her mouth.  Ingmar Bergman is the only filmmaker who can make a seemingly banal story into an eloquent prayer for redemption and reconciliation.\n\n(CAUTION: Dont take mom to see it on mother&apos;s day ... unless...)",

      "name": "Best boxing film since &quot;Raging Bull&quot;?",
      "reviewBody": "Clint Eastwood is a man of faith. He is an artist who is confident and experienced enough to have a deep faith in the audience that he is trying to reach. He is also a master of omission, of the left-out detail/line, trusting in his gut that his audience is willing to participate in his films by exercising their imaginations; that they never want any aspect of the story to be &apos;dumbed-down&apos; for ready consumption. In fact, his trust in the audience to use their own minds to fill in gaps is like a gift of part ownership in the film. &quot;Million Dollar Baby&quot; is a beautiful gift, and a masterpiece if film-making.\n\nEastwood plays Frankie Dunn, an elder boxing coach, manager, and expert &apos;cut man&apos; who runs a gym and is learning Gaelic on the side. He&apos;s a nice enough guy, but he can&apos;t seem to shake the guilt from ghosts in his past (some we&apos;re in on, some not quite). His guilt/shame is a constant just beneath the surface and gives him something of a cold exterior, sometimes frozen. Yet, as played by Eastwood, you know Dunn&apos;s aware of his own plight, but just doesn&apos;t know how to melt the ice. Or more importantly, if he&apos;s deserving of such a meltdown.\n\nEnter Maggie Fitzgerald (Swank). She&apos;s a thirty-something trailer trash woman from southwest Missouri. An unlikely hero for sure. But for my money, Maggie is this generation&apos;s Rocky. That may seem an easy, simplistic, and over-reaching comparison, but the parallels are deep, obvious and myriad. Like many people, Maggie&apos;s dream (being a professional boxer) is always just out of reach, yet she cannot give it up. She works as a waitress to make ends meet (or at least the ends are almost touching), but spends all her spare time training. Like Dunn, Maggie has her own ghosts haunting her, and through these ghosts they bond tighter than super glue. The heart and work (incalculably huge amounts) that Swank put into becoming Maggie are unnoticeable. It&apos;s a silly phrase but it&apos;s as if she was born to play this part. It fits like a glove. The real life parallel of her relationship to Eastwood no doubt played a part in her ability to connect with the character&apos;s relationship to Dunn. Yet this in no way diminishes her accomplishment. She is brilliant.\n\nMorgan Freeman plays Dunn&apos;s right-hand man (Scrape) at the gym, and reprises a role similar to Red from &quot;Shawshank Redemption&quot;. He also voices the omniscient narration to the story, a la Red. Like Dunn and Maggie, he&apos;s similarly bruised, but somehow less deeply. He&apos;s there when both of them need support and helps to bring them together. I can think of nobody acting in film today who can embody kindness and wisdom through friendship and support better than Freeman. He also serves to bring in another Eastwood trademark \u2013 &apos;Banter&apos;. Even when themes are heavy, Eastwood&apos;s sense of humor is never entirely absent and he and Freeman have a good time with each other, as did Bacon and Fishburne in &quot;Mystic River&quot;. These three characters together create a beautiful and true, albeit small, family unit Eastwood&apos;s lifelong themes and &apos;blurring of lines&apos; are on full display: good vs. evil, right vs. wrong, the role of violence, redemption, guilt/shame over previous acts, even god and death. Never one for easy answers, his version of the truth lies in the shadows, quite literally. Cinematographer Tom Stern crafts characters in shadow, shifting in and out of light. There is a grey area between the light and the dark where something approaching truth lies waiting, and this is where Eastwood takes us, then leaves us there to ponder. &quot;Million Dollar Baby&quot; is a shadow play. As accomplished as &quot;Unforgiven&quot; and &quot;Mystic River&quot;, yet even more personal, this film is a triumph of human storytelling. As Bacon&apos;s character says in &quot;Mystic River&quot;, &quot;\u0085and the hits just keep on comin&apos;.&quot;"

      "reviewBody": "Whoever it may be to rightly claim that he invented the action thriller genre (M\u00e9li\u00e8s, I suppose), Henri-Georges Clouzot&apos;s &quot;Le salaire de la peur&quot; is an indispensable milestone on the exciting route to the best films of that kind in the 70&apos;s, 80&apos;s and nowadays. In its tenseness, as symbolized by the danger of explosion of the lorries&apos; loads, it has hardly been surpassed.\n\nThe plot is perfectly worked out from start to end, the leading players act in some of their best parts ever, the (almost) absence of music supports the brutal realism and the consequent choice of authentic outdoor settings contributed a lot to the film&apos;s deserved success. Historically, it ranges between neorealismo and nouvelle vague, and yet it is its pure action and suspense that make it worth watching for younger audiences who wouldn&apos;t go in for just the artistic way. - Only flaw I can see is the curious, rather artificial change in Vanel&apos;s character which has no comprehensible motivation, at least for me whenever I see it.\n\nApart from that, Clouzot&apos;s wife V\u00e9ra (also well-known from his &quot;Les diaboliques&quot;) plays to the &quot;most breathtaking angles&quot; gallery when she bows down to scrub the floor of Dario Moreno&apos;s gin joint. It&apos;s a man&apos;s world after all and there are male perspectives on human survival only. Well, it&apos;s existentialism, mates. Altogether, the black and white photography is gripping. The gun scene between Lulli and Vanel is one of the best montages in film history, and there is more excellent editing in &quot;Salaire&quot; (including the finale) that completely fits the hot atmosphere."

Stand by Me is a great film, you can say it is a drama with some thriller elements.\n\nFour boys hear the location of the dead body of a boy from their small town. The boys go on a trip to look for the body, about 30 miles away. There are some little problems on the way, including another gang with its leader Kiefer Sutherland. One of the boys thinks about his late brother because of the recent events, played by John Cusack. It seems to be a simple story but it is told perfect.\n\nThe performances the boys give, one of them is the late River Phoenix, are all extraordinary. I liked the way their friendship was shown. Just a great movie, see this. 9/10.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie came out when I was nine years old, and I saw it on network TV the following year, lured by the brouhaha that surrounded the use of the &quot;barnyard epithet&quot; during prime time. I loved this movie before I understood it, and I worship it now. Like &quot;Elmer Gantry&quot; or &quot;1984,&quot; it&apos;s a work of didactic art that only fails on an imaginative level -- Sinclair Lewis couldn&apos;t grasp how debased evangelism would become, Orwell couldn&apos;t foresee the excesses of Mao or Pol Pot, and Chayevsky couldn&apos;t envision the absolute decline of television from a vast wasteland to a malevolent sewer. Fox News, reality TV, even the OJ chase, &quot;Network&quot; anticipates every vile bit of it.\n\nNow, it&apos;s ridiculously overwritten -- NO ONE is as articulate as the characters in this film, and most certainly, no one who works in television is as literate as Diana Christensen (the Faye Dunaway character). I doubt that poet laureates or even Eminem could spew as witty an aside as &quot;muttering mutilated Marxism.&quot; But damn if that isn&apos;t part of its charm. Plus, outside of Max Schumacher (William Holden), the characters are pretty much archetypes instead of real people (the Robert Duvall character might as well wear a black cape and top hat), but their two-dimensionality works as a good metaphor for Max&apos;s seduction into the &quot;shrieking nothingness&quot; or television. Plus the actors are so superb they make screeching caricatures into almost-sympathetic characters: Duvall is a credible and charismatic villain, Finch is a fine mad prophet and Faye Dunaway manages to make a shrill, manipulative, soulless neurotic so damn cute and sexy you&apos;ll want to leave your wife for her, too, just as long as she promises to keep sitting cross-legged on your desk and hitching up her skirt. (Therein lies the real eroticism, forget the intentionally mechanical, unerotic coupling later in the flick). Anyway, this is complex, high art masquerading as popular entertainment, go rent it now.",

Of course, things will start to get complicated soon enough.\n\nChan-wook Park has done a great job in adapting the original novel by Sarah Waters, and mixing it with the history of the Japanese invasion of Korea at the beginning of the twentieth century. The plot is a little bit silly sometimes, but Chan-wook Park makes it all tight and fast-paced, and even the most silly moment becomes a moment of beauty and fun. From the first moment, the viewer will be enthralled by the story of these two women and their relationship, and every plot development will just add fun to the whole.\n\nIf the plot and the direction weren&apos;t amazing enough, the movie is as beautiful as they come. From the darkest moment, the most violent, to the most intimate, beauty transpires in every frame, and every scene comes to life and threatens to pop and break free from the screen. This is helped by the amazing work of all the cast, who does an incredible job in bringing this tale to life (it could be criticized, though, some of the heavily accented Japanese, for characters that are supposed to be able to pass as them).\n\nAll in all, &quot;The Handmaiden&quot; is proof that a movie can have a plot, amazing direction, acting, scenery, craziness and the most beautiful package possible. And even if it is almost two hours and a half long, it feels like a breeze.\n\nYou will fall in love with this movie. Just plain great.",

      "reviewBody": "Reminiscent of Costas-Gavras&apos; film Z with its rapid-fire dialogue and staccato rhythms, La Haine (Hate) directed by 28 year-old Mathieu Kassovitz, is a passionate look at racial tensions at a Paris housing project. Although drug dealing, urban decay, and police brutality have been shown in films before, rarely have they had the sense of vitality and urgency shown in La Haine. \n\nThree friends from different ethnic backgrounds live in the Bluebell housing projects on the outskirts of Paris. This is not the Paris of travel brochures or films like Amelie, but a desolate urban landscape, harsh and grim with housing projects that look as if they could be in any big city in the world. Vinz (Vincent Cassel), is a working class Jew; Hubert (Hubert Kounde), the most intelligent and self-reflective of the three, is an African boxer; and Said (Said Taghmaoui), an Arab from North Africa is younger but just as embittered. \n\nThe film depicts their rage against the police whom they see as oppressors. Marginalized economically and politically, without jobs, parents who care, or hope for the future, the streets are their home and they are open targets for police who are shown as brutal and racist. In one startling scene, a veteran cop taunts and physically abuses Said and Hubert while training a rookie cop. The rookie can only look on and shake his head in disbelief.\n\n Shot in black and white, La Haine shows a single day in the lives of the three friends. Following a major riot in which a local teenager, Abdel, is critically wounded by the police, Vinz, the most volatile of the group, vows that if Abdel dies he will kill a cop to get even. Hubert wants to restrain him, and Said doesn&apos;t seem to care either way, as long as he can get his money from a drug dealer named Snoopy. When Vinz finds a Smith &amp; Wesson 44 lost by the police during the riots, the spiral of violence escalates and builds toward a memorable conclusion. \n\nLa Haine does not offer any solutions to social problems but clearly shows the anger and frustration of people who feel trapped by their circumstances. In its depiction of a society in free-fall, it also has immediacy. Three weeks after the film was released, riots broke out in the Brixton section of London, following the death of a young black man in police custody. Though it is a wake-up call for action on society&apos;s growing gap between rich and poor, La Haine makes a powerful statement that violence does not solve anything and that hate begets hate. Someone should pass the word to a few of the world leaders."

      "name": "The consequences of bullying",
      "reviewBody": "Have always been a big fan of anime, particularly Studio Ghibli and Miyazaki without restricting myself to just them (some of my favourites are actually without either involved).\n\nAny film dealing with bullying and its consequences deserves to be applauded for the effort. Bullying, often stemming from something that should be a non-issue but turns out to be an easy target for bullies (for examples if your parents disallow you to play a popular video game for obvious reasons, if you have a posh accent, if you listen to and perform classical music, if you have a physical or social disability, false rumours spread about you, if you were a hard-worker rather than somebody who messed about and disrespected substitute teachers) is something that is very much relevant still and has damaging effects, it is an issue that needs to be addressed and acted upon much more than it is. This is coming from somebody who suffered merciless bullying myself in school, for all the above reasons apart from the first (in my case my school did nothing about it too), and nearly a decade on it has damaged my confidence/self-esteem, made me feel worthless and made my already bad anxiety worse despite getting a degree in music and singing regularly.\n\nSo as one can probably tell, &apos;A Silent Voice&apos; really resonated with me on an emotional level. At the same time, it also really made me think and see that there is much more to the issue, the bully, the witnesses and the victim than one would tend to perceive. &apos;A Silent Voice&apos; also turned out to be a very good film in its own right. It isn&apos;t flawless, some of the supporting characters are under-explored and in a few cases inconsistently and one-dimensionally written and some of the story jumps around and doesn&apos;t always feel complete.\n\nDespite being over two hours, didn&apos;t think it was too long considering the number of characters and their stories. If anything, perhaps &apos;A Silent Voice&apos; would have been even better as a series which would have solved the problems.\n\nOn the other hand, &apos;A Silent Voice&apos; has an awful amount to recommend. Great isn&apos;t a strong enough word to describe the animation. Rich in meticulous background and character detail, atmospheric and ethereal in colour schemes and alive to nuances in its use of settings and character gestures and expressions, it becomes a character of its own and there are some memorable images throughout like towards the end. The music has whimsy, haunting beauty and understatement, while not overbearing the drama and letting it speak when needed. The song is catchy.\n\nThe writing is thought-provoking and contemplative, doing it in a way that will make bullying victims and those who bullied alike identify with what is said. A lot of it is remarkably insightful, and even when the film was really resonating with me it taught me a lot about an issue that isn&apos;t as black and white as perceived. The story has its issues but has a strong emotional core, with the truly powerful and touching ending leaving me shell-shocked.\n\nNot often does one find themselves rooting for a bully as well as the victim, &apos;A Silent Voice&apos; is one of those rarities. The voice acting is dynamic.\n\nIn summary, not perfect but very well done. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

      "name": "Not just a prison film, but an excellent film about not being able to conform in a world that requires it",
      "reviewBody": "Having had the advantage of reading Donn Pearce&apos;s novel about a year before seeing Cool Hand Luke, it was with great anticipation that I awaited it&apos;s transfer to the big screen.  I was not disappointed.\n\nCool Hand Luke could easily be classified by the misguided as just a prison yarn, but it is so much more than that.  It is the story of a man who refuses to be nailed down or conform to the rules and regulations of a society that he has never craved to fit into.  When Lucas Jackson is arrested for cutting heads off parking meters, his explanation to the prison captain(Strother Martin) is &quot;Small Town, not much to do in the evening&quot;, which would have us believe he was just being drunk and stupid.  Later, to one of the other inmates he mutters the same answer, but importantly adds &quot;just settlin some old scores&quot;.  It is a brief but important point in helping to define the character of Luke beyond just being drunk and damaging public property.  As a service man, we also discover that Luke won a bronze star, achieved the rank of sergeant but came out as a private.  Again, early evidence that Luke is unable to conform to any body&apos;s rules but his own. Yet, we are given clear evidence that Luke knows what is right in principal and what is wrong.  At one point in the film when they are putting Luke in the box under less than reasonable circumstances, he tells the boss, &quot;calling it your job don&apos;t make it right, Boss.&quot;  In a visit from his mother Arletta(Jo Van Fleet), Luke says plenty about his own character by telling her, &quot;A man&apos;s got to go his own way&quot; or as he also puts it, &quot;I tried to live always free and above board like you but I can&apos;t seem to find no elbow room&quot;. \n\nAs Luke enters the prison that will supposedly be his home for the next two years, we meet the other inmates.  Some of them wear chains, some of them do not.  It is a point early in the film that director Stuart Rosenberg, emphasizes.  We understand quickly that sooner or later you conform.    You either walk the line the way the bosses tell you to, or they will find the means to get you to walk the line.  As the Captain reiterates, &quot;for your own good, you&apos;ll learn the rules&quot; A point driven home often.\n\nWhat we discover about their crimes is minuscule.  One is jailed for manslaughter after hitting a pedestrian with his car, another is a paper hanger, another new inmate is charged with breaking, entering and assault. The nature of their crimes is unimportant to us.  It enables to view these prisoners as men, and while we don&apos;t feel any genuine sympathy for them, feeling disgusted by their crimes would have been a distraction from the true purpose of Pearce&apos;s story, and Luke as the focal point.\n\n Because of his individuality, it doesn&apos;t take Luke long before he unexpectedly becomes a hero to the other inmates.  It is not a role he chooses, or even wants.  It unexpectedly imposes the burden on him of having to live up to the expectations of others.  He never truly understands the nature of this hero worship, and would be just as happy if he didn&apos;t have to deal with it.  He is still trying to find his way in the world, and if there is any real purpose for his existence.\n\nAnother principal character is Dragline(George Kennedy).  It is he who finally establishes the fact that Cool Hand Luke is a man who can not be beaten.  Dragline&apos;s admiration for Luke seems to extend from the fact that he(Dragline)has learned the rules on how to get by, but yet regrets having lost some of his own individuality in the process.  He is the rest of the inmates in microcosm.  I can&apos;t remember a role that George Kennedy has ever been better in, and he deservedly won the best supporting actor award.\n\nCool Hand Luke is not without it&apos;s humorous moments especially in the  early going.  It is these moments that help move the film from the early stages to the darker more despairing later stages.  Perhaps, for that reason alone we are even more effected by Luke&apos;s dilemma.\n\nIn translating his novel to the screen Donn Pearce along with Frank Pierson, has managed to bring the heart and soul of his nove to the big screen.  Lalo Shifrin&apos;s memorable score emphasizes often the repeated drudgery of working on the chain gang.  Director Stuart Rosenberg made more good films after Cool Hand Luke, but in my opinion never achieved the same degree of perfection that he does here.   \n\nAs Cool Hand Luke, Paul Newman give one of the most memorable performances in a long distinguished career.  It is not an easy task portraying a man who travels the road from being a sincere individualist, to a man who may be beaten and defeated, yet in the end is still unwilling to accept that fate. Although Rod Steiger won the best actor award that year, one could argue that Newman&apos;s role was more difficult, as it required substantially different subtle ranges in character.  As for the failure of Cool Hand Luke to achieve a Best Picture nomination, I&apos;m at a loss to explain that malfunction, especially when the likes of Doctor Doolittle and Guess Who&apos;s Coming To Dinner, far lesser efforts than this were nominated.\n\nCool Hand Luke is a true classic in every sense of the word.  It is a film that will long be remembered.\n\nMy grade: A+",

It could be technically brilliant and leave you in amazement about how a narrative can be structured, leave you thinking about an issue from a totally unique perspective or just leave you thinking.\n\nBut if you believe that the impact a movie has on you is important - you cannot afford to miss this movie. I&apos;ve never written a review in the past 7-8 years of using IMDb but signed up just so I could say how much I loved this movie.\n\nI read a couple of reviews talk about crying during the movie and thought it odd. I can&apos;t remember the last time I cried during a movie - but towards the last 15 minutes of the movie I didn&apos;t only cry - I cried from the depth of my heart, not out of sadness but from a much deeper sense of realization the power of true love and how it can manifest itself. You hear so many times that there is &apos;God&apos; in all of us if we can realize it - at the end of this movie you will know why it&apos;s true.\n\nIt&apos;s a must watch movie.",

You wont even feel the length of 5 hours and 20 minutes. Manoj Bajpai&apos;s has proved once again that he is the powerhouse of acting. Not one scene is out of order and everything is properly explained with no questions unanswered. Dialogues are very sharp and as close to reality as it can get. \n\nThe opening sequence in itself is a masterpiece. The way its scripted and executed is just mind blowing. All the bloodshed keeps getting more and more innovative. Its one of those movies that will always be mentioned everywhere whenever someone talks about the Indian cinema.",

It stands out from most other movies about troubled youths, both in the way that it portrays the main character and in making such good use of seemingly minor events in showing how they shape Antoine&apos;s life.\n\nAs Antoine, Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud (in the role with which he would always be identified) strikes a nice balance in making his character come to life without making any of his actions seem forced or over-dramatic. Truffaut sets things up for him perfectly, by presenting a great variety of situations in his life that allow Antoine&apos;s character to come out naturally. Many of the settings are in themselves interesting and creative, despite being located in familiar types of places.\n\nThe story is written carefully so as to allow the viewer to identify with and sympathize with Antoine, while still seeing his faults clearly. What is often the most affecting thing about it is the way that Truffaut shows how even the most commonplace kinds of events can have such an effect on a maturing person, if they are a source of disappointed expectations or misunderstood intentions. To make this kind of movie so effectively without relying on violent or shocking material is an admirable achievement, and it repays careful thought and attention while watching it."

      "reviewBody": "Many great war films of the Vietnam conflict are centered around these themes of blurred morality and the uselessness of war, and Oliver Stone&apos;s Platoon is among the most well known. Stone, who wrote and directed the film and also served as an infantryman in Vietnam, first rose to fame for his war films that dramatized the infamous Cold War conflict. The main premise of his magnum opus are the inner conflicts within US forces deployed to southeast Asia, rather than the actual physical conflicts between them and the Communist-allied Vietnamese forces. More broadly, Platoon analyzes the &quot;duality of man&quot; concept that has been studied in numerous other works, from fellow Vietnam War films like Full Metal Jacket (1987) and Apocalypse Now (1979), all the way back to the latter&apos;s source material and inspiration in Joseph Conrad&apos;s Heart of Darkness. \n\nPlatoon focuses on the moral decay of soldiers in American units, and how this contributes to their inability to fight their Vietnamese enemies. Charlie Sheen sums up this theme with his on-the-nose voiceover, &quot;We did not fight the enemy, we fought ourselves... and the enemy was in us.&quot;\n\nVietnam War-movies tend to be even harder to watch than most war flicks, as the lines between the &quot;heroes&quot; and &quot;villains&quot; are blurred more than in any other dramatized period of warfare in recent human history. In wars like World War II, which are widely known for being as black and white as military conflicts have become, the contrasting features between the heroic forces we are meant to root for and their opposing enemy platoons are well defined. That is almost never the case with the United States-North Vietnamese/Vietcong conflict in Vietnam during the overarching Cold War.\n\nThat is not to say that most wars throughout human history have not been many shades of grey, with the winners and losers not always corresponding with the righteous and evil. But because of the guerrilla nature and infamous legacy of the Vietnam War itself - namely, the immense public protest against American involvement - the Vietnam War remains by far the most unpopular war in modern American history. With that said, most of the film is fantastic, from the aforementioned narrative to the grim lightning of the southeast Asian jungles that emphasize the film&apos;s tone, to the poignant, melancholic score.",

      "reviewBody": "This movie undid something inside of me. It&apos;s that part of you that holds on to hope that people can be good, that there is hope for humanity. I knew the basics of it when I went to watch it: that it is about investigative reporters looking into a story of abuse in the catholic church. And it uncovered so much more than just that. Honestly, this movie should be seen by anyone who seeks the true face of the world. We don&apos;t live in a pink bubble of happiness. F*cked up things happen to people all the time; worst thing is when it happens to the innocent. The little ones who can&apos;t protect themselves. When they are robbed of their faith and their hope and their future. Sitting in the film theatre on the last row, I was brought to tears as in front of me a long list of places where victims spoke out was scrolling. I was both shocked and mad. I felt sorry that people can fail so miserably. &quot;Mike Rezendes: They knew and they let it happen! It could&apos;ve been you, it could&apos;ve been me, it could&apos;ve been any of us.&quot; Indeed. When we witness darkness and we shut up and we don&apos;t do anything about it, that&apos;s when we fail. A poet once wrote, &quot;You can join the millions talking in the dark. Or you can stand up and scream light, out into the night.&quot; So choose to stand up. In your profession choose to eradicate the oblivion of evil. This movie is a masterpiece. From the dedication of the actors to their roles, to the script, the director and the cinematography. The score? Fantastic. Howard Shore did it again!",

      "reviewBody": "Monsters, Inc.\n\nWe were all, at one time, scared of monsters under the bed. Shadows of clothes in the closet. Weird sounds outside in the trees. I remember thinking there were all kinds of monsters in my room - not as much under my bed as in the closet. And once again, Pixar, who brought us &quot;Toy Story&quot; 1 &amp; 2, plays on both adults&apos; memories and children&apos;s dreams, making it equally enjoyable for both children and adults.\n\nJohn Goodman voices James P. Sullivan, known as &quot;Sulley&quot; to friends. He is a big, blue, hairy monster with horns on his head and hands the size of a watermelon. Billy Crystal is Mike Wazowski, his wisecracking, one-eyed best friend. Both of these monsters live in Monstropolis, a world where monsters roam freely. Their city is powered by a rare source of power - children&apos;s screams. That is where Monsters, Incorporated comes in. At Monsters, Inc., monsters like Sulley and Mike open portals into children&apos;s rooms - through closet doors - and scare the children, capturing their scream in a little yellow bottle. Sulley is the top-scarer, bringing in the most scares. But Randall (the always enjoyable - even when animated - Steve Buscemi), a wormy, multiple-armed lizard-monster with the ability to change appearances to its surroundings, is jealous of Sulley, and will attempt anything to get more scares...even if it means taking a child from the real world and bringing it into Monstropolis. But after the child escapes, Sulley and Mike reluctantly look after it, all the while trying to get it back to the real world before Mr. Waternoose (the late James Coburn) and others find out about the incident...\n\n&quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; does for monsters what &quot;Toy Story&quot; did for toys. Pixar once again not only expands our mind, but our very worlds. I respect their company and commitment values very much, as you can read in my &quot;Toy Story&quot; review. They stick to the values that made Disney films so family-friendly back in the fifties and sixties: Respect for the audience, respect for quality, and respect for the audience&apos;s INTELLIGENCE, something Disney, who has recently coughed up a bunch of lousy, thoughtless sequels, has forgotten. Now, I know that LEGALLY Disney is co-creator of &quot;Toy Story&quot; and &quot;Monsters, Inc.,&quot; but they really are not. They just give Pixar the money and get their name branded on the front box of the film. And even then, I have heard multiple claims that Disney is very mean-spirited towards Pixar (read into sequel trouble for &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;) and gives them the bare minimum.\n\nBut that is straying off the subject. &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; is one of the most enjoyable animated films I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. I didn&apos;t enjoy it as much the first time, but I then bought it, and have since watched it many times. It is an instant classic. I will be watching it years from now, when I am old and frail and in a rocking chair. It ranks right up there with &quot;Toy Story&quot; 1 &amp; 2, and all the OLDER Disney films from the 50&apos;s-70&apos;s. It has all the elements of a sweet, charming, emotional and pleasurably good-natured animated film. And, more coudos to Pixar: Thank you for not packing it full of the language and inappropriate content that Disney shoves into the dark recesses of their films nowadays.\n\nNot only has Pixar brought back the &quot;Family Film&quot; genre to what it should be, but it also redefines it. Pixar&apos;s animated films are some of the most thoughtful, imaginative and enjoyable animated films ever - not to mention 100 % family safe. Thank you, Pixar, for getting back on track.\n\n5/5 stars",

      "reviewBody": "This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Definitely my favorite classic. There are some that come close, such as Citizen Kane, Spellbound, and Psycho, but none quite compare to this amazing movie.\n\nThe first thing that you notice is the outstanding cinematography. You have to remember that this movie was made in 1940, when they didn&apos;t have the technology we have now. But that first shot of the water beating up against the rocks grabs you and for one split second you wonder if maybe this isn&apos;t part of the movie but rather something filmed just recently. But then you see the familiar face of Laurence Olivier, reminding you that this was made 60 years ago, a fact that forever amazes me. The only oscar it won besides Best Picture was well deserved.\n\nAnother thing that makes it such a wonderful film is the acting. I have debated on whether Laurence Olivier&apos;s character, the tortured Maxim de Winter, is the pitiable character or if his second wife played by Joan Fontaine is really the one to feel sorry for. Every time I watch it I see it from a different point of view. Joan Fontaine is excellent. Laurence Olivier is wonderful, but that&apos;s no surprise. The only thing that bugs me is that it seems in every movie he&apos;s in (well, at least, everything I&apos;ve seen him in), he always plays the same type of character.  But he&apos;s extremely good at it, so I suppose it doesn&apos;t matter.\n\nBut although Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier are wonderful, Judith Anderson steals the show! The first time I watched the movie, I was immediately grabbed by her stunning performance as the sinister Mrs. Danvers. You hardly notice the other characters when she&apos;s in the scene. She acted the part so well that it&apos;s strange to imagine that she was any different in real life.\n\nWith a wonderful storyline, and a very surprising ending, Rebecca well deserves the title as the only of Hitchcock&apos;s films to win the oscar for Best Picture. Although it may not be the most famous of all his films, it is without a doubt the greatest"

      "reviewBody": "It&apos;s impossible for me to be objective about this film.  I know every scene and line by heart.  Not because I&apos;m one of those ghastly Python nerds, whose anal obsessiveness sucks the whole spirit out of everything they did, and actually misses the joke, which is on them; they are the perfect subjects for a Python lampoon.  No.  I only know LIFE OF BRIAN so intimately because I&apos;ve seen it so often, it&apos;s still one of the funniest comedies I&apos;ve ever seen, and persists in being hilarious despite familiarity, which, as in so much Python did, is the reverse of what comedy is &apos;supposed&apos; to be made of (i.e. surprise).\n\nAlso, nostalgia value.  MONTY PYTHON were my first heroes, before I even reached double figures.  I gobbled up every programme, film and record in a space of a couple of short years, so they are bound up with a period of my life when I was very happy and hopeful, so I go all misty-eyed when I see it.  Bizarrely, we were first encouraged to watch BRIAN by our Latin teacher, who felt it was very insightful about Roman society.\n\nBut no-one watches PYTHON anymore, except that dorkish clique.  My brother, only a couple of years my junior, is as mystified now by my reaction to it as my parents were then.  But surely BRIAN is a comic masterpiece in itself, accessible to anyone who found the very male, elitist, academic bias of the programme somewhat alienating?\n\nHow can I implore you to watch this?  It&apos;s got a straight narrative, with some of the greatest set-pieces and dialogue of any film ever.  It&apos;s not a great FILM comedy - Terry Jones is no Gilliam - but the style suits the humour perfectly, allowing it to breathe, and sometimes pulling off an extraordinarily evocative shot, such as when Brian and his mother are walking from Jesus&apos; sermon, and squabbling about petty things like big noses, and the camera pulls back to a vast Judean wasteland, with a massive Roman statue being wheeled, and a set of crucifixes being planted: a marvellous encapsulation of a period in history.\n\nThis is the film&apos;s true triumph - it&apos;s a magnificent deconstruction of historical distortion.  By paralleling the life of Christ with that of an ordinary little man, Python reclaim history from symbol and myth.  It brings the body back into history.  Its resolute rejection of divinity leads to a bleak, ironic conclusion (listen to &apos;Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life&apos; carefully, and in context: it&apos;s NOT comforting) - the story of Jesus without redemption is ghastly.\n\nThe intelligence behind the juvenile gags is astonishing - the film is a learned commentary on power, totalitarianism, repression, language, gender, the writing of history, the politics of subversion, the complicity of the repressed.  Myth is thrown to the wind - the film succeeds where Reg and his revolutionaries fail, by revealing a whole series of repressive apparatum (sic?).  No-one is spared - the film is unashamedly destructive, but the film&apos;s satire is not arid or narrow; there are many rich parallels with our own time, as the extraordinary reaction from the religious on the film&apos;s release showed.\n\nBut BRIAN is not just an attack on religion, but on all who would seek to write selective histories for their own interests, suppressing others&apos; voices.  The silliest jokes are also the most profound - in one scene, the kidnappers enter Pilate&apos;s palace through a tiled floor.  They emerge through a modesty-concealing leaf painted on this floor.  This is snickering schoolboy humour, and very very funny, but is also a comment on the phallocentricity of imperialism.  Jokes like these are why BRIAN will always remain vital - it turns you into a ludicrous, ill-informed amateur historian.\n\nThe acting is an astonishing feat of multiple performances, but Graham Chapman, always my favorite Python, holds the chaos together, ironically as the Kafkaesque hero who races towards the abyss, an anti-Jesus to love and identify with.  If I&apos;ve made the film sound like hard work, than I&apos;m an idiot.  The seriousness is only there if you want it.  Like Alice in Wonderland, or Buster Keaton, PYTHON seem to be full of metaphors that encapsulate the pains of life, but are also damnably entertaining.  It&apos;s strange that men as supposedly &apos;surreal&apos; and &apos;out there&apos; as the Pythons should speak such good sense.  Only BRINGING UP BABY, THE PALM BEACH STORY, and MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL, are funnier than this.  Treasure it.",

I&apos;ve been keenly anticipating this film for a long time and rushed out to see it on opening night, but it just didn&apos;t seem to make the grade.\n\nThere was a lot of good about the film. It started well.  It had that &apos;soft touch&apos; of a master-director.  The costumes and background of 60s Hong Kong was superb.  And the acting, especially Maggie&apos;s was great.  There was some superb cinematography and mise-en-scene - the quick pans, crossing the line and other great touches, but the film just lacked something.\n\nOK, this is the part where my criticism is weak. I can&apos;t put my finger on what it lacked.  I&apos;m tempted to suggest something to do with the story or the plot, but just look at my favourite Wang Kar Wai film, Days of Being Wild, and that criticism doesn&apos;t hold up.  Maybe it was character.  Maybe the romance just didn&apos;t quite seem to spark - no Tianmimi/Comrades this. Sorry, but to say what was wrong I&apos;d have to go watch all his movies again then this one for comparison.  That doesn&apos;t sound too bad, but not too practical for me at the moment.\n\nAll that said, this is still well worth a look, and of course a must see for fans.\n\nBri"

You may need some Kleenex as I was overwhelmed for a large part of this movie.\n\nI had the honor of seeing this movie at a preview screening with the real &quot;Paul&quot; and his wife attending - what an absolute amazing experience to be in their presence. This movie will make you rethink everything about what it means to be human and how much we need to think about all our neighbours in this world.\n\nDon&apos;t miss it!"

His life changes when an invitation from the heavyweight champ Apollo Creed is given to him.\n\nRomance, Drama, Fight.\n\nStory- With minimum resources and low money, this movie was an underdog itself. Stallone wrote it and fought to play Rocky. When they were low on resources, they changed the story all together and made it even better. The story is flawless and keeps you on the edge of your seat. 9/10 \n\nMusic- The best thing about the movie itself. The music in this movie is guaranteed to give you goosebumps every time you watch it. Bill Conti gives you an excellent score throughout the movie, including the famous &quot;gonna fly now&quot;. 10/10 \n\nActing- 4 nominated performances in this movie. The acting is very good as well, especially Burgess Meredith who offers one of the greatest acts I have ever seen. Stallone plays Rocky Balboa and changes his voice very well to be Rocky. He did a very good job. Talia Shire plays Adrian, a shy pet store owner who has never had a BF before. She did a good job as well. Burt Young plays the drunkard Paulie. Burgess Merideth plays the boxing trainer Mickey. I have never seen a better performance. 9.5/10 \n\nStallone fought for this triumphant movie that made me want to go the distance (sounds corny but its true). It made me strive to work harder and not give up. If you haven&apos;t seen this, buy it and watch it. I&apos;ll guarantee it will change you too. A classic.\n\nI give it a perfect 10/10",

      "reviewBody": "There is a character in &apos;Amores perros&apos; who looks like Karl Marx.  He is a tramp and an assassin, a good bourgeois who one day, Reggie Perrin-like, abandoned his family, and, un-Reggie Perrin-like, joined the Sandanistas in an effort to create a better world, earning 20 years in prison for his troubles.  Walking the streets with a creaky cart and a gaggle of mangy dogs, he was found by the policeman who jailed him, who gave him a dingy place to live, food, and the odd, non-official contract.\n\nEl Chivo is the soul of the film, the missing link, both in appearance (a man called &apos;The Goat&apos;, who has rejected the civilities of society and lives a beast-like existence with his dogs, amongst the ruins of civilisation), and narrative function.  With intricate structure, &apos;Amores perros&apos; tells three stories, one of underclass Mexican life, where survival depends on what New Labour calls &apos;illegal economies&apos; (dog-fighting, bank-robbing etc.), where bright young women are stifled and degraded by thoughtless pregnancies and brutal marriages, where single mothers depend (and usually can&apos;t depend) on shiftless sons for subsistence; and this world&apos;s mirror opposite, the world of the media, of celebrity, of models and magazine editors, of daytime TV, perfume advertising campaigns and bright apartments.  Family life is central here too, although in this case it is torn apart by more pleasanntly bourgeois ailments like ennui and dissatisfaction.\n\nThese two stories are mediated by the narrative of El Chivo, the man who left one of these worlds for the other, but who still negotiates the two, through his search for the daughter he left as a toddler, and in his &apos;job&apos;, wiping out businessman.  If Mexico is emerging as part of the super-confident globalism of high-capitalism, than El Chivo is the grizzly sore thumb, the ex-Sandinista, the Marx lookalike, the man who said no, the drop-out, the forgotten, the depleted spirit of the Left,  happily killing and torturing the servants of the new economic regime.\n\nThere is something Biblical about his hirsute ascetism too, presuming to judge the &apos;Cain and Abel&apos; half-brothers, one an adulterer, the other with a contract out on his sibling, another example of family gone badly wrong. This, the bleak funeral and grave scenes, and Octavia&apos;s functional crossing himself every time he passes an icon on the landing, are the sole residual elements of religion in a society once ostentatiously religious.\n\nExcept for the director.  Like Paul Thomas Anderson in &apos;Magnolia&apos;, although to a less self-conscious degree, Gonzales Inarritu is the God of his film, intricately creating the structure that links his characters and their different environments.  These are negative connections, however, which work against the idea of coherent meaning in life - contact usually results in destruction (physical, material, spiritual), or diminishing.\n\nHe is also an Old Testament god, punishing those who would get too confident with their future plans or their seemingly inviolable present success - the gains of capitalism are prey to the violent whims of chance: Gonzalez Inarritu doesn&apos;t need frogs to shake a rigid society or mindset.\n\nMoral change is linked to physical change - being beaten up, losing a leg, cutting hair.  The punning title, with its reference to the dog-eat/fight-dog nature of modern life, and its general unsatisfactoriness, also gives the film its Biblical feel, the idea of Mexico as an asphalt desert, or a rubbish heap, with all these scrawny mutts scavenging the remains.\n\n&apos;Amores perros&apos; shares  the sickly, bleached near-monochrome look of many recent crime films, like &apos;Chopper&apos; or &apos;Bleeder&apos;.  But where the heightened mise-en-scene in those works were expressionistic projections of their protagonists&apos; psychosis, here it&apos;s part of a controlling world-view, the universal consciousness that creates, connects and destroys.\n\n The three stories, though connected narratively and symbolically, are mutually distinct - the first is an exhilirating mix of violent gangster film and frustrated romance; the second is like a short story (the screenwriter is a novelist), a figurative plot where movement is through image, symbol and idea, rather than film narrative; the third is a kind of spiritual journey, with an appropriately Biblical (or Wim Wenders-like) openness.\n\n&apos;Amores perros&apos; is not quite as amazing as its admirers claim - it says more about contemporary cinema that a film only has to hold your interest for it to be a masterpiece - but it is consistently enthralling, and, despite all the stylistic tics and brutal violence, bracingly humanist.",

      "reviewBody": "Director Hayao Miyazaki won a place in my heart after I saw his 2001 film Spirited Away. I&apos;m in no position to claim to be an expert on Miyazaki (I&apos;ve only seen three of his films), nor am I really a big fan of Japanese animation; but I can safely say that Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind is one of the very best animated films I have ever seen. The beauty of the animation is stunning, with its close attention to detail--every frame is constructed as a work of art--and the story is enthralling. As with other Miyazaki films, the majority of characters are much more three-dimensional that you typically get in Western animated features, and nearly all of them aren&apos;t exactly what they seem to be.\n\nNausica\u00e4, which is based on Miyazaki&apos;s gargantuan Manga series, is set in the distant future, after fires destroyed much of the earth. The world is being consumed by the Sea of Decay, a toxic forest that spreads through airborne spores and is protected by giant insects called ohmu. The Valley of the Wind is one of the last pure places on earth, and its Princess, Nausica\u00e4, is a strong-willed yet free-spirited young woman seeking to solve the mystery of the Sea of Decay. A nearby nation, which claims to have harnessed the power that allowed humans to rule the earth a thousand years before, takes over after a plane carrying a mysterious living cargo crashes in the valley. What follows in the film is a struggle, not of good versus evil, but of man versus nature. The story is complex, as is its message, and Miyazaki has ingeniously spun deep complexities into the animated characters: what look like foes may not be, and what look like friends may be a bit more dangerous.\n\nThe animation is colorful, sweeping, expansive, and beautiful, as are the plot and characters. There is an immediacy to the story that makes a big emotional impact and makes us question how we handle our position in nature. As one of the characters in the film asks, have humans become but a tribe destined to be swallowed by the Sea of Decay? It is ultimately a film about compassion in the face of violence and war, which is what makes it so different from Western features.\n\nDisney&apos;s recent DVD release is excellent. The film can be watched either in the original Japanese audio or Pixar&apos;s dub with Patrick Stewart and Uma Thurman, and there are separate subtitles for each language track--a literal one (hallelujah!) for the Japanese track, and a more closed-captions style set for the English track. The film is so stunning in the Japanese that I have never considered watching the dub, though a fellow film buff has said that it is &quot;not so bad.&quot; After this film was released in the US in the 1980s in a completely mangled version called Warriors of the Wind, Miyazaki suspended all US rights of all his other films until the distributor would honor the stipulation that they be released without any editing. The fact that Disney, which is known for watering down nearly everything it touches, has done this with such a non-Western-style movie is amazing.",

      "reviewBody": "&quot;Before Sunrise&quot; was one of the most beautiful independent love stories of the 90&apos;s. Part of its appeal came from the open ending. We didn&apos;t know how the lives of these two young people would continue and what would become of them. The whole movie was like a snapshot that left the rest to our imagination. A sequel to such a story seemed to be unnecessary, but apparently director Richard Linklater himself couldn&apos;t stop thinking about these two intriguing characters and had to envision their lives after this one fateful day in Vienna.\n\nHere it is now, the most unlikely sequel I have ever seen, &quot;Before Sunset&quot; - made not for money but for pure artistic purpose only. Much of the magic of part one could have been destroyed, but somehow Linklater and his two main actors managed to pull it off. &quot;Before Sunset&quot; takes place nine years after Jesse and Celine first met and as soon as the movie starts you feel like you meet old friends you haven&apos;t seen in a long time. You know these people and immediately feel at home with them. I was afraid that &quot;Before Sunset&quot; might give answers to questions that shouldn&apos;t be answered in the first place. If &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; was a dream that two young people had, then this movie could only be the rude awakening, the confrontation with reality. And somehow it is just that. It&apos;s a bit disillusioning to hear that all did not turn out as well as one might have imagined. We learn that Jesse and Celine are not particularly happy in their lives and that they are not really the romantic persons they used to be nine years ago. The soothing thing to see, however, is that they are still here. They both have passed their 30th birthday, they have jobs and their future is more or less decided, but they&apos;re still longing for passion in their lives and as soon as they meet each other, it&apos;s there again. They might have given up a lot of their dreams and beliefs but one thing remains true: their feelings for each other. While they&apos;re talking it&apos;s like they turn back time and become the young, hopeful people they once were again. I&apos;m getting a bit carried away, but that&apos;s the beauty of these two movies, &quot;Sunrise&quot; and &quot;Sunset&quot;. The story sucks you in and you&apos;re not able to stop thinking about it for a long while.\n\nAnother thing &quot;Before Sunset&quot; did, it made me reflect on my own life. How have I changed in the past nine years? What has become of my dreams? Obviously, I have gotten more cynical, because at times I was irritated by Celine&apos;s talk about environmental problems and her emotional outbursts. It took me way longer than last time to &quot;bond&quot; with her character this time around.\n\nAnyway, the performances by Hawke and Delpy are wonderful once again. Their acting is as natural as can be, and thinking of Hawke&apos;s recent divorce in real life you wonder how much of his character in the movie is based on his own personal experiences.\n\nUnfortunately, the movie is over way too soon. After about an hour you have already arrived at the final scene - a scene that is just amazing. It makes you hope that somehow everything will work out for Jesse and Celine and that maybe they will stay together this time. As part one, &quot;Before Sunset&quot; doesn&apos;t have a definite ending, though.\n\nIt&apos;s sure nice to see that apparently Linklater cares about Jesse and Celine as much as I do and made such a good sequel. He could probably even make a third part. &quot;Before Sunset&quot; has convinced me that it could work.",

      "name": "A fantastic Capra film.",
      "reviewBody": "It Happened One Night directed by Frank Capra was made and released in 1934 by Columbia Pictures as a small budget film that was not expected to do well at the box office. Yet, after its release the film gained many accolades and won the Academy Award for best picture in 1934. Due to the original small nature of the film, the leading man role was surprisingly filled by Clark Gable who was on loan from another studio. He stared opposite of Claudette Colbert. Capra&apos;s film was a combination of many ideals, emotions and social perceptions of the American society of the thirties but it was also a combination of many new and innovative filming techniques and sound advancements. The film unfolds the story in such a attention-grabbing and remarkable way that most of today&apos;s cinema use his style and ideals when producing and creating films. Capra used the idea of a moving camera, one that was not fixed upon a box, but on a moveable crane instead. This produced more sweeping shots, more angles for filming and fewer distance shots. It allowed for more movement of the actors as well as a more realistic and real life feeling to the movie. The film also incorporates back projection of images. This is were a scene is filmed previously and played in the background while the actors perform the scene in front of the projection. Back projection is used for car scenes to give the impression that the actors are driving but in reality they are in a sound stage. Capra also incorporated the use of a wipe in his film. The technique of moving left to right and fading in or out to change a scene or show elapsed time took the place of the traditional place cards in silent films and allowed for a more constant stream for the film. The film was also all talk, the new technology of a sound strip on the side of the film was used. The text cards of silent films were completely discarded. Another camera trick by Capra is to show a change in feelings within Clark Gable&apos;s character for Claudette Colbert&apos;s character by depicting her character in a different light. This happens two times within the film at key moments to the development of their relationship. Claudette Colbert is seen in a close up of softer light to emphasize Clark Gable&apos;s character seeing her in a `different light.&apos; In this romantic comedy Capra not only showed new styles and techniques but also addressed social issues of the time. Through comedy he showed the outlandish nature of the rich (King arriving for his own wedding in a helicopter) and the nature of man being the controller in relationships as well as in society. The fighting and struggles between the two main characters showed the man taking care of the woman, the social norms of how men and woman should act around each other in that era. But the fighting and the banter also show a strong-minded and intelligent woman. The two strong-willed main characters balanced each other out.\n\nCapra&apos;s techniques for showing the social relationship between the rich and working classes as well as a relationship between man and woman in the 1930s captured film makers and film viewers for over 70 years. Films are now compared to his style of camera movement and his style of capturing the American ideals. When movies of today make a similar statement of achieving what one wants they are referred to as Capra-esc. Capra&apos;s imagination and style is one that changed the outlook of American films and introduced a new genre to film goers everywhere."

      "reviewBody": "Although I have disliked Bergman&apos;s earlier films and thought they were by far too overrated, that did not apply to this film. I saw the director&apos;s-cut version, over five hours. A little long, yes, and there is not much music, but it&apos;s not slow, like Tarkovsky&apos;s films can be. \n\nThe opening is great, and the first act, the first one and a half hour, was the part I liked the very most. The realism is utter, so is the casting; the best acting I have seen in a Swedish film, it&apos;s amazing. I can&apos;t complain about any actor, they were all extremely good. So is the dialog. Alexander had a typical upper class look, so did his grandmother, who looked extremely fresh and healthy and beautiful, for her age. All together, the language and milieus are very credible. No over-colorful costumes and silly dialogs, that is such a frequent element nowadays in historical plays, especially from America. \n\nBergman succeeds to capture the customs and behavior that were used (and to some extent still is used) within the Swedish upper class, as well as general Swedish customs and behavior. I know this, because I am familiar with it and have partly experienced it myself. The result is sometimes amazing. Bergman succeeds to capture the atmosphere of the old times, through language and decoration. The photo is at time dazzling; some scenes are identical to 19th century Swedish painting, and I get the thought that Bergman turned to these in search for the right setting of the film.\n\n Unlike early works by Bergman, which tend to be somewhat theatrical, the keyword here is realism, which I appreciate greatly. The actors manage, like I said, to speak and play in a way that I feel was customary at that period of time. It might be too much to claim this work to be a Swedish Tarkovsky film, but I sensed it had some philosophical material, and it is definitely thoughtful. Otherwise, I think it is worth watching for the acting and dialog alone.\n\nOne of the best Swedish films ever made, and Bergman&apos;s best, in my opinion. (9/10)",

      "reviewBody": "I wish I could locate a videocassette of this film--subtitled, not dubbed. The first time I saw it, I was a little put off by what I thought was a pompous disclaimer that &quot;not one foot&quot; of documentary footage had been used. But, in light of the finished product, it&apos;s a remarkable statement. If a film has better captured the harsh and ugly realities that are an inevitable part of a true revolutionary movement, I never saw it. It is greatly to its credit that one never gets a sense of &quot;good guys vs. bad guys&quot; here--only of people trapped in a truly impossible set of circumstances, from which no escape is possible without confrontation and bloodshed. It was depressing to see this movie in Berkeley in the early 70s, and hear the audience cheer the &quot;heroic&quot; Algerian revolutionaries while booing the &quot;villainous&quot; French, in view of the great pains that had been taken to present a balanced viewpoint. This film is thrilling, heartbreaking, thought-provoking, and beautiful--sometimes by turns and sometimes all at once. If you haven&apos;t seen it and it show up anywhere in the vicinityh, drop everything and go--and pray that it&apos;s subtitled and not dubbed. (There are dubbed prints and, as is usually the case, dubbing pretty nearly wrecks it.) This is a masterpiece."

Except George Clooney&apos;s Daniel Ocean all the protagonists in above movies/series were simple men. A Banker, a School Teacher and an Architect with no criminal history. They lived their normal lives until they were forced to do the impossible. George Kutty&apos;s story go by the same logic. If I dare compare Dhrisham to Shawshank Redemption (which incidentally is my all-time favorite movie) not much need to be told about the quality of the script, the direction and the performances. Dhrishyam is Mollywoods entry to world class family thrillers. For the entire second half of the movie Malayalam Cinema was elevated to the class of Hollywood. We had several art films or those parallel movies to brag about, but until Dhrishyam not many thriller or family drama type movies of Malayalam could have been called world class. Though the last 15 minutes of the movie went very predictable, Jeethu has managed to keep his audience at the edge of the seat for more than an hour and except die hard Mohan Lal haters, who would be too intimidated and upset for all wrong reasons; it&apos;s hard to find anyone who may complain about the movie.",

I&apos;ve hardly ever cared more about a character, and even after only five minutes into the film, I wanted so desperately to protect her. Giulietta Masina is so masterful in her performance, and Federico Fellini, her husband, is as masterful in his direction. I did not believe that they could match their success with La Strada, but, in fact, they succeeded in surpassing it. Bravo. 10/10. One of the best films ever made, plain and simple.",

      "reviewBody": "Having had the privilege of visiting Russia and anticipating a return next month, I admit to being a complete Russophile.  The mystery, emotion and history of this remarkable country have found places in my soul I was scarcely aware of.  This masterful film manages to evoke the sensations I felt during my month&apos;s long visit.  The Russian people, among the dearest I have known, have suffered as have few others in all of history.  The art of this magnificent country is always tinged in dark tones.  The music, if not in a minor key, evokes minor key emotions.  The literature, even with Gogol, clearly delineates the suffering and hardships with which all Russians are familiar.  Therefore, it was not surprising to find all of this so strongly depicted in Andrei Rublyov.  However, the beauty that somehow transcended the misery and bleakness constantly before the viewer was redemptive.  The scene in which the iconographer holds the sobbing boy is one of the most touching and devastating on film.  I sat before the screen with tears streaming down my cheeks.  It may sound hyperbolic, but I found this film absolutely life-changing.  I am returning to Russia to volunteer in an orphanage.  Moreover, I am fully prepared to end my life in that great enigmatic country.  Indeed, this film has changed my life.  I cannot recommend it too highly."

      "reviewBody": "This is one of those rare films that gets better each time you watch it. With something for everyone, The Princess Bride combines romance, action, adventure and parody to create the perfect movie.\n\nCary Elwes and Robin Wright are beautiful to watch and the story of their love is a wonderful backdrop to the adventure and intrigue played out in this story. Mandy Patinkin is wonderful as Inigo and gets to deliver some of the best lines in the film. Chris Sarandon is perfect in his role as the bad guy prince.\n\nThe plot is rich, with adult innuendos the kids will miss all together and levels of wit to entertain the whole family. The dialogue is full of very funny catch phrases-  many of which are still part of my repertoire more than a decade after I first saw the movie.   If you like dry humor and fast wit, The Princess Bride will make your day.\n\nI have owned this video since 1988 and still watch it regularly - it has become my &apos;sick day&apos; movie because it is such a joy.",
